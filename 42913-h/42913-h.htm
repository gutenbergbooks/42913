<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</a></h2>


<p>This book, a first attempt to survey and define the whole
field of eugenics, appears in the year which finds us
celebrating the centenary of the birth of Charles Darwin
and the jubilee of the publication of <i>The Origin of Species</i>.
It is a humble tribute to that immortal name, for it is
based upon the idea of <i>selection for parenthood</i> as determining
the nature, fate and worth of living races, which
is Darwin's chief contribution to thought, and which
finds in eugenics its supreme application. The book is
also a tribute to the august pioneer who initiated the
modern study of eugenics in the light of his cousin's
principle. A few years ago I all but persuaded Mr.
Galton himself to write a general introduction to eugenics,
but he felt bound to withdraw from that undertaking,
and has given us instead his Memories, which we could
ill have spared.</p>

<p>The present volume seeks to supply what is undoubtedly
a real need at the present day&mdash;a general introduction to
eugenics which is at least considered and responsible.
I am indebted to more than one pair of searching and
illustrious eyes, which I may not name, for reading the
proofs of this volume. My best hopes for its utility are
based upon this fact. If there be any other reason for
hope it is that during the last six years I have not only
written incessantly on eugenics, but have spoken upon
various aspects of it some hundreds of times to audiences
as various as one can well imagine&mdash;a mainly clerical
assembly at Lambeth Palace with the Primate in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_viii" id="p_viii">[viii]</a></span>
Chair, drawing-rooms of title, working-class audiences
from the Clyde to the Thames. It has been my rule to
invite questions whenever it was possible. Such a
discipline is invaluable. It gives new ideas and points
of view, discovers the existing forms of prejudice, sharply
corrects the tendency to partial statement. It is my hope
that these many hours of cross-examination will be
profitable to the present reader.</p>

<p>It has been sought to define the scope of eugenics, and
my consistent aim has been, if possible, to preserve its
natural unity without falling into the error, which I
seem to see almost everywhere, of excluding what is
strictly eugenic. Our primary idea, beyond dispute, is
selection for parenthood based upon the facts of heredity.
This, however, is not an end, but a means. Some
eugenists seem to forget the distinction. Our end is a
better race. If then, beyond selecting for parenthood,
it be desirable to take care of those selected&mdash;as, for
instance, to protect the expectant mother from alcohol,
lead or syphilis&mdash;that is strict eugenics on any definition
worth a moment's notice. It then appears, of course,
that our demands come into contact with those prejudices
which political parties call their principles. A
given eugenic proposal or argument, for instance, may be
stamped as “Socialist” or as “Individualist,” and people
who have labelled their eyes with these catchwords,
which eugenics will ere long make obsolete, proceed to
judge eugenics by them. But the question is not
whether a given proposal is socialistic, individualistic or
anything else, but whether it is eugenic. If it is eugenic,
that is final. To this all parties will come, and by this all
parties will be judged. The question is not whether
eugenics is, for instance, socialist, but whether socialism
is eugenic. I claim for eugenics that it is the final and
only judge of all proposals and principles, however
labelled, new or old, orthodox or heterodox. Some<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_ix" id="p_ix">[ix]</a></span>
years ago I ventured to coin the word eugenist, which is
now the accepted term. With that label I believe any
man or woman may well be content. If this be granted,
the old catchwords and the bias they create forgotten,
we may be prepared to consider what the scope of eugenics
really is.</p>

<p>Eugenics is not, for instance, a sub-section of applied
mathematics. It is at once a science, and a religion,
based upon the laws of life, and recognising in them the
foundation of society. We shall some day have a eugenic
sociology, to which the first part of this volume seeks to
contribute: and the sociology and politics which have
not yet discovered that man is mortal will go to their
own place.</p>

<p>Only when we begin to think and work continuously
at eugenics is its range revealed. The present volume is
a mere introduction to the principles of the subject:
the full elucidation of its practice is a problem for generations
to come. Nor is it easy to set logical limits to our
inquiry. We may say that eugenics deals with conceptions:
and that the care of the expectant mother is
outside its scope: but of what use is it to have a eugenic
conception if its product is thereafter to be ruined by, for
instance, the introduction of lead into the mother's
organism? Again, the care of the individual is, in part,
a eugenic concern: for if we desire his offspring we
desire that he shall not contract transmissible disease
nor vitiate his tissues with such a racial poison as alcohol.
Plainly, everything that affects every possible parent is a
matter of eugenic concern: and not only those factors
which affect the choice for parenthood.</p>

<p>It follows that the second portion of this volume,
which deals with the practice of eugenics, cannot be more
than merely indicative. In the available space it has
been attempted to define certain constituents of practical
eugenics, but in any case the entire ground has not been<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_x" id="p_x">[x]</a></span>
surveyed. The concept of the <i>racial poisons</i> may be
commended to special consideration. Whether a poison be
so-called “chemical,” as lead, or made by a living organism,
as the poison of syphilis, is of great practical importance,
because of the infection involved in the second case:
but, in principle, both cases belong to the same category.
Sooner or later, eugenists must face the transmissible
infections, and repudiate as hideous and devilish the
so-called morality which discountenances any attempt
to save unborn innocence from a nameless fate. He
or she who would rather leave this matter is placing
“religion” or “morality” or “politics” above the welfare
of the life to come, and therein continuing the daily
prostitution of those great names.</p>

<p>Again, the practice of eugenics may be commended
and accepted as the business of the patriot: and two
chapters have been devoted to the question as seen from
the national point of view. I am of nothing more certain
than that the choice for Great Britain to-day is between
national eugenics and the fate of all her Imperial predecessors
from Babylon to Spain. The whole book
might have been written from this standpoint, but such
a book would have been beneath the true eugenic plane,
which is not national but human. I believe in the
patriotism of William Watson, who desires the continuance
of his country because, as he addresses her,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“O England, should'st thou one day fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0 poemdots">&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Justice were thenceforth weaker throughout all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The world, and truth less passionately free,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And God the poorer for thine overthrow.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This is a patriotism as splendid and vital as the patriotism
of the music-halls and of the political and journalistic
makers of wars is foul and fatal: and it is only in terms
of such patriotism that the appeal to love of country is
permissible in the advocacy of eugenics, which is a concern
for all mankind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p_xi" id="p_xi">[xi]</a></span></p>

<p>The prophet of that kind of Imperialism which has
destroyed so many Empires, has lately approved the
emigration of our best to the Colonies, on the ground
that “it is good to give the second eleven a chance.”
But as students of history know, it is at the heart that
Empires rot. The case of Ireland is at present an
insoluble one because the emigration of the worthiest has
had full sway. So with the agricultural intellect: the
“first eleven” having gone to the towns. Rome sent
her “first eleven” to her Colonies: if you were not good
enough to be a Roman soldier you could at least remain
and be a Roman father: and the children of such fathers
perished in the downfall of the Empire which they could
no longer sustain. I can imagine no more foolish or
disastrous advice than this of Mr. Kipling's, in commending
that transportation of the worthiest which,
thoroughly enough persisted in, must inevitably mean
our ruin.</p>

<p>The national aspect of eugenics suggests its international
aspect, and its inter-racial aspect. Not having spent six
weeks rushing through the United States, I am unfortunately
dubious as to the worth of any opinions I may
possess regarding the most urgent form of this question to-day.
I mistrust not merely the brilliant students who,
unhampered by biological knowledge, pierce to the
bottom of this question in the course of such a tour, but
also the humanitarian bias of those who, like M. Finot,
or the distinguished American sociologist, Mr. Graham
Brooks, would almost have us believe that the negro is
mentally and morally the equal of the Caucasian. Least
of all does one trust the vulgar opinions of the man in
the street. Wisdom on this matter waits for the advent
of real knowledge. Similarly in the matter of Caucasian-Mongolian
unions. I question whether any living
man knows enough to warrant the expression of any
decided opinion on this subject. Merely I here recognise<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_xii" id="p_xii">[xii]</a></span>
miscegenation in general as a problem in eugenics, to
which increasing attention must yearly be devoted. But
it would have been ridiculous to attempt to deal with that
great subject here. As for the marriage of cousins, to
take the opposite case, I always reply to the question,
“Should cousins marry?” that it depends upon the
cousins. The good qualities of a good stock, the bad
qualities of a bad stock, are naturally accentuated by
such unions: I doubt whether there is much more to be
said about them.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the following general study of a subject to which
no human affair is wholly alien, it has been impossible
to deal adequately with the great question of eugenic
education&mdash;that is to say, education <i>as for parenthood</i>.
If only to emphasise its overwhelming importance, one
must here insist upon the argument. There is, I believe,
no greater need for society to-day than to recognise that
education must include, <i>must culminate in</i>, preparation
for the supreme duty of parenthood. This involves
instruction regarding those bodily functions which exist
not for the body nor for the present at all, but for the
future life of mankind. The exercise of these functions
depends upon an instinct which I have for some time been
in the habit of terming the <i>racial instinct</i>&mdash;a name which
at once suggests to us that we are to represent this instinct,
to the boy or girl at puberty, not as something the satisfaction
of which is an end in itself&mdash;that is the false and
degrading assertion which will be made by the teachers
whom youth will certainly find, if we fail in our duty&mdash;but
as existing for what is immeasurably higher than any
selfish end. Youth must be taught that it is for man
the self-conscious, “made with such large discourse,
looking before and after,” as Hamlet says, to deal with
his instincts in terms of their purpose, as no creature
but man can do. The boy and girl must learn that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_xiii" id="p_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
racial instinct exists for the highest of ends&mdash;the continuance
and ultimate elevation of the life of mankind.
It is a sacred trust for the life of this world to come.
We must teach our boys what it is to be really “manly”&mdash;the
fine word used by the tempter of youth when he
means “beast-ly.” To be manly is to be master of
this instinct. And the “higher education” of our
girls, as we must teach ourselves, will be lower, not
higher, if it does not serve and conserve the future mother,
both by teaching her how to care for and guard her body,
which is the temple of life to come, and how afterwards
to be a right educator of her children. The leading idea
upon which one would insist is that the key to any of
the right and useful methods of eugenic education is to
be found in the conception of the racial instinct as existing
for parenthood, and to be guarded, reverenced, educated
for that supreme end. It is for the reader who may be
responsible for youth of either sex with this key to solve the
problem on the lines best suited to his or her particular case.</p>

<p>By the application of mathematical methods to
statistics we can ascertain their real meaning, if they
have any. If, as frequently happens, they have none,
mathematical analysis is worse than useless. Mr. Galton
is the pioneer of this study, which Professor Karl Pearson
has named biometrics. Biometrics is not eugenics, as
some have supposed, but is a branch of scientific enquiry
which, like genetics, obstetrics and many more, contributes
to the foundations of eugenics. In the Appendix
reference is made to various publications, mostly inexpensive,
which deal with biometrics. In the text I have
availed myself of biometric, genetic and other results
impartially. Differences of opinion between this school
and that of scientific workers are to be regretted by the
eugenist; but it is for him to accept and use knowledge
of eugenic significance no matter by what method it has
been obtained. Directly he fails to do so he ceases to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_xiv" id="p_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
a eugenist and becomes the ordinary partisan. No
reference is made in the following pages, for instance, to
the <i>law of ancestral inheritance</i>, formulated by the Master
to whom the volume is dedicated and of whom all eugenists
are the followers. I believe that law, despite its beauty,
to be without basis in fact and incompatible with demonstrated
Mendelian phenomena: and though the book is
dedicated to Mr. Galton, it is more deeply dedicated to
the Future. This, indeed, is the <i>Credo</i> of the eugenist:
<i>Expecto resurrectionem mortuorum, et vitam venturi
saeculi.</i></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Woman is Nature's supreme instrument of the future.
The eugenist is therefore deeply concerned with her
education, her psychology, the conditions which permit
her to exercise her great natural function of choosing the
fathers of the future, the age at which she should marry,
and the compatibility between the discharge of her incomparable
function of motherhood and the lesser
functions which some women now assume. Obstetrics,
and the modern physiology and psychology of sex, must
thus be harnessed to the service of eugenics, and I hope
to employ them for the elucidation, in a future volume,
of the problems of woman and womanhood, thus
regarded.</p>

<div class="chapterblockcentered">“A little child shall lead them”</div>


<p>This book will be mere foolishness to those who repeat
the inhuman and animal cry that we have to take the
world as we find it&mdash;the motto of the impotent, the forgotten,
the cowardly and selfish, or the merely vegetable,
in all ages. The capital fact of man, as distinguished
from the lower animals and from plants, is that he does
not have to take the world as he finds it, that he does
not merely adapt himself to his environment, but that
he himself is a creator of his world. If our ancestors had
taken and left the world as they found it, we should be
little more than erected monkeys to-day. For none who
accept the hopeless dogma is this book written. They
are welcome to take and leave the world as they find it;
they are of no consequence to the world; and their existence
is of interest only in so far as it is another instance
of that amazing wastefulness of Nature in her generations,
with which this book will be so largely concerned.</p>

<p>Beginning, perhaps, some six million years ago, the
fact which we call human life has persisted hitherto,
and shows no signs of exhaustion, much less impending
extinction, being indeed more abundant numerically and
more dominant over other forms of life and over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_2" id="p_2">[2]</a></span>
inanimate world to-day than ever before. It is a continuous
phenomenon. The life of every blood corpuscle
or skin cell of every human being now alive is absolutely
continuous with that of the living cells of the first human
beings&mdash;if not, indeed, as most biologists appear to
believe, of the first life upon the earth. Yet this continuous
life has been and apparently always must be lived in a
tissue of amazing discontinuity&mdash;amazing, at least, to
those who can see the wonderful in the commonplace.
For though the world-phenomenon which we call Man
has been so long continuous, and is at this moment
perhaps as much modified by the total past as if it were
really a single undying individual, yet only a few decades
ago, a mere second in the history of the earth, no human
being now alive was in existence. “As for man, his days
are as grass: as a flower of the field, so he flourisheth.
For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; and the
place thereof shall know it no more.” Indeed, not merely
are we individually as grass, but in a few years the hand
that writes these words, and the tissues of eye and brain
whereby they are perceived, will actually <i>be</i> grass. Here,
then, is the colossal paradox: absolute and literal continuity
of life, every cell from a preceding cell throughout
the ages&mdash;<i>omnis cellula e cellula</i>; yet three times in every
century the living and only wealth of nations is reduced
to dust, and is raised up again from helpless infancy.
Where else is such catastrophic continuity?</p>

<p>Each individual enters the world in a fashion the
dramatic and sensational character of which can be
realised by none who have not witnessed it; and in a few
years the individual dies, scarcely less dramatically as
a rule, and sometimes more so. This continuous and
apparently invincible thing, human life, which began so
humbly and to the sound of no trumpets, in Southern
Asia or the neighbourhood of the Caspian Sea, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_3" id="p_3">[3]</a></span>
which has never looked back since its birth, and is now
the dominant fact of what might well be an astonished
earth, depends in every age and from moment to
moment upon here a baby, there a baby and there yet
another; these curious little objects being of all living
things, animal or vegetable, young or old, large or small,
the most utterly helpless and incompetent, incapable even
of finding for themselves the breasts that were made for
them. If but one of all the “hungry generations” that
have preceded us had failed to secure the care and love
of its predecessor, the curtain would have come down
and a not unpromising though hitherto sufficiently
grotesque drama would have been ended for ever.</p>

<p>This discontinuity it is which persuades many of us
to conceive human life to be not so much a mighty maze
without a plan, as a mere stringing of beads on an endless
cord of which one end arose in Mother Earth, whilst the
other may come at any time&mdash;but goes nowhere. The
beads, which we call generations, vary in size and colour,
no doubt, but on no system; each one makes a fresh
start; the average difference between them is merely
one of position; and the result is merely to make the
string longer. Or the generations might be conceived
as the links of an indeterminate chain, necessarily held to
each other: but suggesting not at all the idea of a living
process such that its every step is fraught with eternal
consequence. In a word, we incline to think that History
merely goes on repeating itself, and we have to learn that
History never repeats itself. Every generation is epoch-making.</p>

<p>It is thus to the conception of parenthood as the vital
and organic link of life that we are forced: and the whole
of this book is really concerned with parenthood. We
shall see, in due course, that no generation, whether of
men or animals or plants, determines or provides, as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_4" id="p_4">[4]</a></span>
whole, the future of the race. Only a percentage, as a
rule a very small percentage indeed, of any species reach
maturity, and fewer still become parents. Amongst
ourselves, one-tenth of any generation gives birth to
one-half the next. These it is who, in the long run,
make History: a Kant or a Spencer, dying childless,
may leave what we call immortal works; but unless
the parents of each new generation are rightly chosen
or “selected”&mdash;to use the technical word&mdash;a new
generation may at any time arise to whom the greatest
achievements of the past are nothing. The newcomers
will be as swine to these pearls, the immortality of which
is always conditional upon the capacity of those who
come after to appreciate them. There is here expressed
the distinction between two kinds of progress: the
traditional progress which is dependent upon transmitted
achievement, but in its turn is dependent upon racial
progress&mdash;this last being the kind of progress of which
the history of pre-human life upon the planet is so largely
the record and of which mankind is the finest fruit
hitherto.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is possible that a concrete case, common enough,
and thus the more significant, may appeal to the reader,
and help us to realise afresh the conditions under which
human life actually persists.</p>

<p>Forced inside a motor-omnibus one evening, for lack of
room outside, I found myself opposite a woman, poorly-clothed,
with a wedding-ring upon her finger and a baby
in her arms. The child was covered with a black shawl
and its face could not be seen. It was evidently asleep.
It should have been in its cot at that hour. The mother's
face roused feelings which a sonnet of Wordsworth's
might have expressed, or a painting by some artist with
a soul, a Rembrandt or a Watts, such as we may look for<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_5" id="p_5">[5]</a></span>
in vain amongst the be-lettered to-day. Here was the
spectacle of mother and child, which all the great historic
religions, from Buddhism to Christianity, have rightly
worshipped; the spectacle which more nearly symbolises
the sublime than any other upon which the eye of a
man, himself once such a child, can rest; the spectacle
which alone epitomises the life of mankind and the
unalterable conditions of all human life and all human
societies, reminding us at once of our individual mortality,
and the immortality of our race&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">“While we, the brave, the mighty and the wise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We Men, who in our morn of youth defied<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Elements, must vanish;&mdash;be it so!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Enough, if something from our hands have power<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To live, and act, and serve the future hour:”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>&mdash;the spectacle which alone, if any can, may reconcile us
to death; the spectacle of that which alone can sanctify
the love of the sexes; the spectacle of motherhood in
being, the supreme duty and supreme privilege of womanhood&mdash;“a
mother is a mother still, the holiest thing
alive.”</p>

<p>This woman, utterly unconscious of the dignity of her
attitude and of the contrast between herself and the
imitation of a woman, elegantly clothed, who sat next
her, giving her not a thought nor a glance, nor yet room
for the elbow bent in its divine office, was probably some
thirty-two or three years old, as time is measured by the
revolutions of the earth around the sun. Measured by
some more relevant gauge, she was evidently aged, her
face grey and drawn, desperately tired, yet placid&mdash;not
with due exultation but with the calm of one who has
no hope. She was too weary to draw the child to her
bosom, and her arms lay upon her knees; but instead
she bent her body downwards to her baby. She looked
straight out in front of her, not at me nor at the passing<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_6" id="p_6">[6]</a></span>
phantasms beyond, but at nothing. The eyes were open
but they were too tired to see. The face had no beauty
of feature nor of colour nor of intelligence, but it was
wholly beautiful, made so by motherhood; and I think
she must have held some faith. The tint of her skin and
of her eyeballs spoke of the impoverishment of her blood,
her need of sleep and rest and ease of mind. She will
probably be killed by consumption within five years and
will certainly never hold a grand-child in her arms. The
pathologist may lay this crime at the door of the tubercle
bacillus; but a prophet would lay it at the reader's door
and mine.</p>

<p>While we read and write, play at politics or ping-pong,
this woman and myriads like her are doing the essential
work of the world. <i>The worm waits for us as well as for
her and them: and in a few years her children and theirs
will be Mankind.</i> We need a prophet to cry aloud and
spare not; to tell us that if this is the fate of mothers
in the ranks which supply the overwhelming proportion
of our children, our nation may number Shakespeare and
Newton amongst the glories of its past, and the lands of
ancient empires amongst its present possessions, but it
can have no future; that if, worshipping what it is
pleased to call success, it has no tears nor even eyes for
such failures as these, it may walk in the ways of its
insensible heart and in the sight of its blind eyes, yet it
is walking not in its sleep but in its death, is already
doomed and damned almost past recall; and that, if it
is to be saved, there will avail not “broadening the basis
of taxation,” nor teaching in churches the worship of the
Holy Mother and Holy Child, whilst Motherhood is
blasphemed at their very doors, but this and this only&mdash;the
establishment, not in statutes but in the consciences
of men and women, of a true religion based upon these
perdurable and evident dogmas&mdash;that all human life is<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_7" id="p_7">[7]</a></span>
holy, all mothers and all children, that history is made
in the nursery, that the individual dies, that therefore
children determine the destinies of all civilisations, that
the race or society which succeeds with its mammoth
ships and its manufactures but fails to produce men and
women, is on the brink of irretrievable doom; that the
body of man is an animal, endowed with the inherited
animal instincts necessary for self-preservation and the
perpetuation of the race, but that, if the possession of
this body by a conscious spirit, “looking before and
after,” is anything more than a “sport” of the evolutionary
forces, it demands that, the blind animal instincts
notwithstanding, the desecration of motherhood, the
perennial slaughter and injury of children, the casual
unconsidered birth of children for whom there is no room
or light or air or food, and of children whose inheritance
condemns them to misery, insanity or crime, must cease;
and that the recurrent drama of human love and struggle
reaches its happy ending not when the protagonists are
married, but when they join hands over a little child that
promises to be a worthy heir of all the ages. This religion
must teach that the spectacle of a prematurely
aged and weary and hopeless mother, which he who runs
or rides may see, produced by our rude foreshadowings
of civilisation, is an affront to all honest and thoughtful
eyes: that where there are no mothers, such as mothers
should be, the people will assuredly perish, though
everything they touch should turn to gold, though
science and art and philosophy should flourish as never
before. I believe that history, rightly read, teaches these
tremendous lessons.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In our own day the bounds of imagination are undoubtedly
widening. Means of communication, the press,
the camera, the decadence of obsolete dogmas, making<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_8" id="p_8">[8]</a></span>
room for the simple daily truths of morality which have
“the dignity of dateless age” and are too hard for the
teeth of time&mdash;these account in large measure for the
fact that the happier half of the world is at last beginning
to realise how the other half lives. There is perhaps more
divine discontent with things as they are than ever heretofore:
this being due, as has been suggested, perhaps
as much to the modern aids of imagination as to any
inherent increase of sympathy. Science, too, in the
form of sociology and economics, adds warrant to the
demand for some radical reform of the conditions of life.
It teaches that all forms of life are interdependent; that
society is thus an organism in more than merely loose
analogy; that the classes pay abundantly for the state
of the masses: whilst medicine teaches that the tuberculosis,
for instance, which slays so many members of
the middle and upper classes, is bred by and in the
overcrowding of the lower classes, this and many other
diseases promising to resist all measures less radical than
the abolition of half our current social practice.</p>

<p>Hence it is that we hear so much of social reform;
and the promises of representatives of many political
-isms jostle one another at the gates of our ears. The
Anarchist at one extreme, and the Collectivist at the
other, with the Individualist and the Socialist somewhere
between, offer their panaceas. To me, I confess, they
seem little better than the scholastic metaphysicians
of old days, like them mistaking words for things,
incapable of understanding each other, evading precise
definition and using terms which never mean the same
thing twice as missiles and weapons of abuse: and,
above all, mistaking means for ends.</p>

<p>But the leading error common to them all, as I seem to
see it, is their conception of society as a stable thing&mdash;a
piece of machinery which must be properly <span class="pagenum"><a name="p_9" id="p_9">[9]</a></span>“assembled,”
as the engineers say; forgetful of the extraordinary
discontinuity which inheres in the swift-approaching
death of all its parts, and their replacement by helpless
immaturity. The first fact of society really is that all
its individuals are mortal. This we all know, but I
question whether even Herbert Spencer fully reckoned
with it; and certainly the common run of social speculators
have not begun to realise what it means. Human
life is made up of generations, and the key to all progress
lies in the nature of the relation between one generation
and another. Spencer records the case of an Oxford
graduate, desirous to be his secretary, who did not know
that the population of Great Britain is increasing. Here
is a capital present fact of the&mdash;merely quantitative&mdash;relation
between successive generations. So far as any
influence on their theory or practice is concerned, it is
still unknown to nearly all our advisers. Yet this fact
of the ceaseless multiplication of man, which has distinguished
him from the first, and is absolutely peculiar
to him of all living species, animal or vegetable, as
Sir E. Ray Lankester has lately pointed out, is the
source of the major facts of history and the besetting
condition of every social problem that can be named at
this hour.</p>

<p>The professional and dedicated teachers of morality
seem to be in little better case. They believe in babies,
perhaps, as the prime and only really valid source of the
weal and wealth and strength of nations, and as the
great moralisers and humanisers of the generation that
gives them birth. They are beginning to join in that
public outcry against infant mortality which will yet
abolish this abominable stain upon our time. But they
are lamentably uninformed. They do not know, for
instance, that a high infant mortality habitually goes
with a high birth-rate, not only in human society but in<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_10" id="p_10">[10]</a></span>
all living species; and they have yet to appreciate the
proposition which I have so often advanced and which,
to me at any rate, seems absolutely self-evident, that
until we have learnt how to keep alive all the healthy
babies now born&mdash;that is to say, not less than ninety
per cent. of all, the babies in the slums included&mdash;it
is monstrous to cry for more, <i>to be similarly slain</i>.
These bewailings about our mercifully falling birth-rate,
uncoupled with any attention to the slaughter
of the children actually born, are pitiable in their blindness
and would be lamentable if they had any effect&mdash;of
which there is fortunately no sign whatever, but
indeed the contrary.</p>

<p>Humanitarian sentiment, also, is terribly misguided.
“Why always the benefit of the future, has the present
no claim upon us?” I have been asked. Assuredly all
sentient life, and therefore pre-eminently all human
life, in which sentiency is so incommensurably intensified
by self-consciousness, the power of “looking before and
after,” has a claim upon us: but the question could
have been asked by no one whose imagination had been
worthily employed. Our posterity will in due course
be as actual and present as we, their deeds and sufferings
and hopes as actual and present as ours. They outnumber
us as the ocean outweighs a raindrop; to avert
evil from one of them is as much as to relieve evil in one
of us,&mdash;how much more to prevent the misery of five
in the next generation, fifty in the next and unnumbered
hosts beyond? To serve the future of the race is not to
benefit a fiction: the men and women of a hundred and
a thousand years hence will be as real as we. And to
serve the future is to put out our talent at compound
interest a thousand-fold compounded. The weak imagination
would rather build a sanatorium for consumptives
and see it filled with grateful patients. This is a palpable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_11" id="p_11">[11]</a></span>
sensible good, for which the meanest visual faculty
suffices: but the strong imagination would rather open
the closed windows of nurseries or work at the mechanical
problems of ventilation, aye, or even at the structure of
the bacteriological microscope&mdash;finding the spectacle, in
the mind's eye, of healthy men and women fifty years
hence as grateful and as real a reward as the sight of
a sanatorium in the present. The pace of progress will
be incalculably hastened when men, whether workers
or bequeathers or administrators, enlarge their imaginations
so as to perceive that the future will be, and therefore
indeed is, as real as the present.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> I appeal to the reason of
the kind-hearted reader. Would you rather make one
man or child happy now, or two or a thousand a century
hence?</p>

<p>It is, in a word, the idea of continuous causation or
evolution that explains the remarkable contrast between
our outlook on the future and our fathers'. In older&mdash;that
is to say, younger&mdash;days, men's interest in posterity
was most naïvely and quaintly selfish. If they raised
a monument or did any piece of work which obviously
would endure beyond the span of their own lives, their
chief motive seems to have been that we should think
well of them, nor forget how well they thought of themselves.
They were not concerned with us, but with our
opinion of them. They were anxious about the verdict
of posterity; and the verdict is that they little realised
their responsibility for us, or betrayed it if they did.
There is also the frank attitude of Sir Boyle Roche's
famous bull, “What has posterity done for us?” This
is a quite familiar and conspicuous sentiment&mdash;as familiar
as any other form of selfishness: but it is as if a father
<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_12" id="p_12">[12]</a></span>should say, “What have my children done for me?”
and is open to the same condemnation. We are assuredly
responsible for posterity as any parent for any child.
Before the nineteenth century this fact could be realised
by very few. To-day, when the truth of organic evolution
is a commonplace, and when the plasticity of the
forces of evolution is slowly becoming realised, we must
face our tremendous responsibility and privilege in a
spirit worthy of those to whom such mighty truths
have been revealed.</p>

<p>Parenthood and birth&mdash;in these the whole is summed.
At the mercy of these are all past discovery, all past
achievement in art or science, in action or in thought.
The human species, secure though it be, is only a race
after all; only a sequence of runners who <i>quasi cursores,
vitaï lampada tradunt</i>&mdash;like runners, hand on the lamp
of life, as Lucretius said. This it is which, to the thoughtful
observer, makes each birth such an overwhelming
event. It is a great event for the mother and the father,
but how much greater if its consequences be only half
realised. Education in its full sense, “the provision of
an environment,” as I would define it, is a mighty
and necessary force, for nothing but potentiality
is given at birth: but no education, no influence of
traditional progress, can avail, unless the potentialities
which these must unfold are worthy. The baby comes
tumbling headlong into the world. The fate of
all the to-morrows depends upon it. Hitherto
its happening has depended upon factors animal and
casual enough, utterly improvident, concerned but rarely
with this tremendous consequence. Fate may be
mistress, but she works only too often by Chance, as
Goethe remarked. Fate and Chance hitherto have
never failed to keep up the supply which the death of
the individual makes imperative: and forces have<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_13" id="p_13">[13]</a></span>
been at work determining for progress, to some extent,
but most imperfectly, the parentage of these headlong
babies. Yet the human intelligence cannot remain
satisfied with their working&mdash;and much less so when
it realises how they can be controlled, how effectively,
and to what high ends. The physician may and must
concern himself, on these occasions, with the immediate
needs of the mother and the child, and when these are
satisfied he may feel that his duty has been done; but,
as he journeys homewards, he must surely reflect&mdash;that
this astonishing thing, then, has happened again, as
indeed it has happened many times this very day; that
whilst this baby is to become an individual man or
woman, an end in himself or herself, in its young loins
and in those of its like are the hosts of all the unborn
who are yet to be. If, then, these babies differ widely
from each other, as they do; if these differences are, on
the whole, capable of prediction in terms of heredity;
if the future state of mankind is involved in these
differences, which will in their turn be transmitted to
the children of such as themselves become parents; and
if this business of parenthood will be confined to only
a <i>small</i> proportion of these babies, <i>of whom one-half
will never reach puberty</i>; if these things be so, as
they are, cannot these babies be chosen in anticipation,
there being thus effected an enormous vital economy,
Nature being commanded to the highest ends by the
only method, which is to obey her, as Bacon said; and
the human intelligence thus making its supreme achievement&mdash;the
ethical direction and vast acceleration of
racial progress? What man can do for animals and
plants, can he not do for himself? Give imagination its
fleetest and strongest wing, it can never conceive a
task so worth the doing.</p>

<p>This, and this alone, is what requires to be brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_14" id="p_14">[14]</a></span>
home to the general reader and the reformer alike. Says
Mr. H. G. Wells: “It seemed to me then that to prevent
the multiplication of people below a certain standard,
and to encourage the multiplication of exceptionally
superior people, was the only real and permanent way
of mending the ills of the world. I think that still.”
And then, in a few sketchy pages, Mr. Wells discredits,
as with one glance of great eyes, the very proposal which
he thinks to be the only real and permanent way of
mending the ills of the world. Not one man in thousands
has got so far as to hold this opinion; and it is the more
lamentable that Mr. Wells, having reached it, should
hold it in the loose, formal, and inoperative fashion in
which the man in the street or the woman in the pew
holds the dogmas of orthodox theology. We need to
educate public opinion&mdash;that “chaos of prejudices”&mdash;up
to Mr. Wells' standard, and then we need to accomplish
the much harder task of converting a mere intellectual
speculation into a living belief.</p>

<p>But so surely as this belief, the crowning and practical
conclusion to which all the teachings of modern biology
converge, comes to life in men's minds, so surely
the difficulties will be met, not only on paper but also
in practice. “Where there's a will there's a way.”
Meanwhile men are content to work at the impermanent,
if not indeed at measures which directly war against
the selection of the best for parenthood: they do not
realise the stern necessity of obeying Nature in this
respect&mdash;for it is Her selection of parents that alone
has raised us from the beast and the worm&mdash;and since
necessity alone, whether inner or outer, whether of
character or circumstance, is the mother of invention,
they fail to find the methods by which our ideal can be
carried out. There is nothing, either in the character
of the individual man and woman, or in the structure<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_15" id="p_15">[15]</a></span>
of society, that makes the ideal of race-culture impossible
to-day: nor must action wait for further knowledge of
heredity. Little though we surely know so far, we have
abundance of assured knowledge for immediate action
in many directions&mdash;knowledge which is agreed upon by
Lamarckians and neo-Lamarckians, Darwinians and
Weismannians, Mendelians and biometricians alike. All
of these agree, for instance, as to the fact that the
insane tendency is transmissible and is transmitted by
heredity. We need only public opinion to say, “Then
most surely those who have such a tendency must forgo
parenthood.”</p>

<p>For it is public opinion that governs the world. If
it were, as it will be one day&mdash;which may these pages
hasten&mdash;an elementary and radical truth, as familiar
and as cogent to all, man in the House or man in the
public-house, as the fact of the earth's gravitation&mdash;that
racial maintenance, much more racial progress,
depends absolutely upon the selection of parents; if
the establishment of this selective process in the best
and widest manner were the admitted goal of all legislation
and all social and political speculation&mdash;who can
question that the thing would be practicable and indeed
easy? Without the formation of public opinion this is
as hopelessly Utopian and inaccessible an ideal as words
ever framed; public opinion once formed, nothing could
be more palpably feasible. Hence Mr. Galton's wisdom in
demanding that, before we dictate courses of procedure,
and even before we can expect profit from scientific
investigation, whether by the biometric method of which
he is the founder, or by any other, <i>public opinion must
be formed</i>; that the idea of eugenics or good-breeding
must be instilled into the conscience of civilisation like
a new religion&mdash;a religion of the most lofty and austere,
because the most unselfish, morality, a religion which<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_16" id="p_16">[16]</a></span>
sets before it a sublime ideal, terrestrial indeed in its
chosen theatre, but celestial in its theme, human in its
means, but literally superhuman in its goal. If the
intrinsic ennoblement of mankind does not answer to this
eulogy, where is the ideal that does?</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a><br />
<small>THE EXCHEQUER OF LIFE</small></h3>

<div class="chapterblock">

<p>“This last lustrum has enabled us to make an astounding
discovery, of which neither Adam Smith nor Cobden nor Malthus
dreamed&mdash;that a nation is composed not of property nor of
provinces, but of men.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Tille</span> (1904), quoted by <span class="smcap">Forel</span>.</p>
</div>


<p>The main thesis which the last chapter was intended
to introduce is, in the words of Ruskin, simply this:
“There is no wealth but life.” The assumption throughout
this book is that Ruskin is the real founder of political
economy, he first of moderns having seen this supreme
truth.</p>

<p>We speak of a nation's possessions, but possessions
imply a possessor or possessors. Wealth, as Ruskin
teaches us, is “the possession of the valuable by the
valiant.” If our national possessions were made over to
a race of monkeys, “they being inherently and eternally
incapable of wealth,” what would they be worth?
Furthermore, to possess and to be possessed by, are
totally diverse things. Says Ruskin, “Lately in a
wreck of a Californian ship, one of the passengers fastened
a belt about him with two hundred pounds of gold in
it, with which he was found afterwards at the bottom.
Now, as he was sinking&mdash;had he the gold or had the
gold him?”</p>

<p><em class="psection">Vital economics.</em>&mdash;We have already alluded to the
unique property of mankind in virtue of which the radical
character of the essential wealth, which is life, has only
too commonly been forgotten. In the case of any animal<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_18" id="p_18">[18]</a></span>
or vegetable species we should have no difficulty, if
asked regarding its “success” and “prospects,” in
directing our enquiry to essentials. We should examine
the individuals of that species, young and old, its death-rate
and its birth-rate, and these would supply us with
the answer. In the case of man there is the almost
incalculable complication involved in the fact that he
is capable of making external acquirements,&mdash;material
possessions and spiritual possessions which, so long as
he remains capable of possessing them, are of real value,
and, on account of what they mean for life, are a true
though secondary wealth. Amongst civilised mankind,
therefore, the essential question as to the breed of men
and women is obscured by the secondary question as
to their traditional or transmitted possessions or external
acquirements. But if we remember the case of the
drowning man and his gold we shall realise that, fundamentally,
the case is the same for the human as for
any other species. No one can openly question this,
but not one publicist or politician in a thousand believes
it in any living sense. The true function of government,
said Ruskin, is the production and recognition of human
worth. This has only to be said to be admitted; it
is one of the thoughts that shine, as Joubert says. No
one denies it and no one acts upon it.</p>

<p>In this sense such a phrase as the National Exchequer
begins to take on a new meaning, and the Chancellor of
the Exchequer loses every whit of his importance, except
in so far as his proceedings tend towards, or away from,
the production and recognition of human worth. He
plays with money, whereas the Chancellor of the real
Exchequer would work for life.</p>

<p><em class="psection">The facts of childhood to-day.</em>&mdash;But since human
life is discontinuous, since three times in a century the
essential wealth of nations is reduced to dust, and raised<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_19" id="p_19">[19]</a></span>
again from helpless infancy, our urgent business is with
the children of the nation. What, then, in general, are
the facts of the National Exchequer thus conceived?</p>

<p>We find that, so far as ordinary physical health is
concerned, the majority of human babies&mdash;including, for
instance, so-called Anglo-Saxon babies&mdash;are physically
healthy at birth. On the other hand, a certain proportion
are as definitely and obviously unhealthy at the very start
as the more fortunate majority are healthy. If certain
influences, such as alcohol and <i>some few</i> diseases, have
been in operation, the babies may be already doomed&mdash;not
national wealth, but national <i>illth</i>. In the absence
of these pernicious factors, there is, on the whole, <i>physical</i>
fitness. The ratio is perhaps as ninety to ten per cent.</p>

<p>Here then, is, on the whole, a ceaseless supply of
essential wealth; physically, at any rate, of good enough
quality. As every one knows, or should know, the greater
part of it we immediately proceed to deface and destroy.
Our mouths are full of argument concerning the principles
of what we are pleased to conceive as political economy.
The principles of vital economy we do not enquire into
but outrage and defy at every turn. So horribly and
wastefully are we misguided that in point of fact we
actually destroy altogether the greater number, not of
all the children merely, but even of the fit and healthy
children; and it may forcibly be argued that, before
any one proceeds to attempt any choice amongst the
children, as to which shall in their turn become parents
and which shall not, it would be well, apart from any
question of discrimination, to revise radically the methods
which at present permit this wholesale destruction.
Whilst we kill outright by hundreds of thousands every
year, we damage for life far more, including a very large
proportion of those who, as things at present are, will in
their turn become the parents who alone are the makers<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_20" id="p_20">[20]</a></span>
of the real wealth of nations. If this destructive process
had the effect which common notions of heredity would
lead us to expect, then most certainly not merely would
Britain, for instance, be doomed, but the very name
would long ago have become “one with Nineveh and
Tyre.” But though this destructive process (which it
is best to describe as resulting in deterioration rather
than degeneration) has been long continued, and though,
in consequence of the great economic changes of last
century and the rush into the cities with their over-crowding,
it is perhaps more disastrous now than ever
before: <i>yet</i> it remains true that most of the babies born
in the slums are splendid little specimens of humanity&mdash;so
far as physique is concerned&mdash;bearing no marks of
degeneration to correspond with the deterioration of their
parents. In a word, heredity works&mdash;the racial poisons
apart, as we shall see&mdash;so that each generation gets a
fresh start. <i>If there be no process of selection</i>, each
new generation begins where its predecessor began and
is as a whole neither worse nor better, whether physically
or psychically.</p>

<p><em class="psection">Eugenics and infant mortality.</em>&mdash;In the face of the
foregoing, which merely outlines the appalling indictment
that ought to be framed against civilisation for its treatment
of its children, it is evidently incumbent upon us to
answer the objector who should say that the whole purpose
and argument of our present enquiry is premature,
and that surely our first business should be not to propose
any novel and revolutionary doctrine as to the choice of
parents and of children, but rather to stop this child
slaughter and child damage&mdash;in other words, that we
should devote ourselves rather, not to providing children
with a good heredity, but to providing them with a good
environment, it being only too demonstrable that the
environment we at present provide for the great majority<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_21" id="p_21">[21]</a></span>
of them is deadly and abominable in the extreme. This
argument is all the stronger because most of the children
are admittedly fit physically at birth. It would seem as
if there were little to complain of in their heredity, whilst
there is certainly almost everything to complain of in
their environment.</p>

<p>If this objection is to be met at all, we must be most
careful and serious in our going. Whatever conclusions
we come to we must at any rate be sure that we do not
impugn or deny the instant, immediate and constant law
of love which declares that there can be no adequate ideal
short of doing our best for all children, once they are
born&mdash;nay, more, from the very moment, months before,
at which their individual history starts. Whoso suggests
that, as a present and immediate policy, it is not right to
care for all children, healthy or diseased, welcome or
unwelcome, nurseried in Park Lane or in the slums, may
have plausible and even so-called eugenic arguments on
his side, but his proposal is essentially immoral and therefore
essentially false. For all children actually in being&mdash;whether
they await or have passed the particular moment
of birth&mdash;it is our duty, ideal and real, to do our utmost.
The believer in the principle of race-culture or eugenics&mdash;whom
I shall hereafter, as for some years past, call the
eugenist&mdash;may believe that it would have been better had
some of these children never been born; he may believe
that, in the present unorganised state of society, in the
present dethroned state of motherhood, it were vastly better
had many even of the healthy majority never been born.
He may be convinced that, since so many of them will
certainly die, failing our feeble efforts to save childhood,
their birth is a misfortune: but on no terms and for no
objects whatever does, or can, the eugenist propose that
any of these children, even though from the moment of
birth they be riddled with disease, should be allowed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_22" id="p_22">[22]</a></span>
die. Though some will say that the keeping alive of
diseased children, or even of many children at first
healthy, is a disaster, I maintain that no such question of
choice, selection or discrimination can find any warrant
in any form of morality&mdash;eugenic or other&mdash;from the
moment at which the child in question began its individual
existence. Those of us who advocate the
eugenic idea must be perpetually on our guard against
the insidious alliance of any who, agreeing with our
premises, declare that it is a mistake, for instance, to
prosecute a campaign against infant mortality. I myself
have had a share&mdash;by a continuous propaganda started
in 1902&mdash;in making this last a publicly recognised question,
whilst, on the other hand, I have done my best to popularise
the idea of eugenics. Let me repeat here what I
have already said elsewhere: that I strenuously repudiate
any suggestion that the eugenic end is legitimately or
effectively to be served by permitting the infant mortality
to continue. The distinguished Egyptologist, Professor
Flinders Petrie, in his recent book <i>Janus in Modern Life</i>,
describes as follows the results of the present crusade
against infant mortality, as he conceives them:&mdash;“We
must agree that it would be of the lower or lowest type of
careless, thriftless, dirty, and incapable families that the
increase [of surviving children] would be obtained. Is
it worth while to dilute our increase of population by ten
per cent. more of the most inferior kind? Will England
be stronger for having one-thirtieth more, and that of the
worst stock, added to the population every year? This
movement is doing away with one of the few remains of
natural weeding out of the unfit that our civilisation has
left to us. And it will certainly cause more misery than
happiness in the course of a century.”</p>

<p>Here, plainly, is a serious argument. We are bound
to sympathise with its underlying assumption, viz.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_23" id="p_23">[23]</a></span>
that not all babies are such as we can desire to carry
on the race. Still more must we sympathise with any
author whatever who has imagination and foresight
enough to write anywhere, on any subject, wrongly or
rightly, such a sentence as “and it will certainly cause
more misery than happiness in the course of a century.”
We need more such authors. But without going into the
whole argument here&mdash;as, for instance, regarding the
singular use of the word “natural”&mdash;I do most entirely
deny the right of the eugenic idea to any voice or place as
to the fate of children <i>once they have come into being</i>.
Another writer, arguing on the same lines, says <i>à propos</i>
of the abolition of infant mortality: “This last change
which, as the Huddersfield experiment shows, is easy of
accomplishment, is likely to be completely effected in the
next few years, and we shall then have abolished the one
factor which in any important degree at present tends
to redress the balance between the rates of reproduction
of the superior and the inferior classes.” These are the
words of Dr. W. McDougall, the distinguished psychologist.
Dr. McDougall has subsequently shown that he repudiates
the apparent deduction from them, and entirely
approves of the present campaign of mercy to childhood.
Nevertheless, these arguments, plainly derived from the
principle of natural selection, do express a most important
truth&mdash;viz., that indiscriminate survival must lead to
racial decadence, whether in man, microbe or moss. I
submit that the difficulty can be solved only by the
eugenic principle.</p>

<p>The fittest must become parents, and the unfit<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> must
not; then kill the unfit, says Nature. And this indeed,
in all living species other than man, is what Nature does.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_24" id="p_24">[24]</a></span>But “thou shalt not kill,” says the moral law&mdash;not even
the unfit. As the foregoing will have shown, some
thinkers to-day propose to avail themselves in this
dilemma of the “New Decalogue”:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Thou shalt not kill but need'st not strive<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Officiously to keep alive.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This is no solution of the problem. There is only one
solution, and that is the eugenic solution. Nature can
preserve a race only by destroying the unfit. We who
are intelligent must preserve and elevate the race by
preventing the unfit from ever coming into existence at
all. We must replace Nature's selective death-rate by a
selective birth-rate. This is merciful and supremely
moral; it means vast economy in life and money and
time and suffering; it is natural at bottom, but it is
Nature raised to her highest power in that almost
supra-natural fact&mdash;the moral intelligence of man.</p>

<p><em class="psection">The dilemma defined.</em>&mdash;The moral law, and our natural
human sympathy, insist that we should seek to preserve
all the children that come into the world, to amplify the
health of the healthy, and to neutralise, as far as possible,
the unfitness of the unfit. A mother brings her malformed
baby to the surgeon, and he does his best to patch
up the gaps left by the imperfect processes of development.
Otherwise the baby will die. Who dares look that mother
in the face and say “Ah, but it is better for the race that
your child should die!” Such a doctrine, I submit, blasphemes
our humanity; it is intolerable to any decent
person who will pause to think what it means: and yet, in
so saying, we seem to defy Nature with her imperative
law of the survival of the fittest only. Pre-eugenic
writers on evolution state the case in all its hardness.
Dr. Archdall Reid says that <span class="pagenum"><a name="p_25" id="p_25">[25]</a></span>“If we wish to improve
the individual, we must attend to his acquirements by
providing proper shelter, food, and training.” Well, we
do wish to improve the individual, and to preserve the
individual! We do not wish the super-man on the terms
of Nietzsche&mdash;the super-man obtained at the cost of love
would turn out to be inferior to any brute-beast, an
intellectual fiend. But, Dr. Reid goes on to say, “such
means will not effect an improvement of the race....
On the contrary, they will cause deterioration<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> by an
increased survival of the unfit.” The provision of
“proper shelter, food and training” will cause racial
decadence! Is it not evident, then, that such provisions
must rather be styled improper, and that we must refrain
from doing anything for the defects and needs of the
individual, lest a worse thing befall the race? This is
an outrageous proposition, yet it is offered us as a necessary
inference from the principle of natural selection or the
survival of the fittest&mdash;which no one now dares to dispute.</p>

<p>Herbert Spencer, to whom we owe the phrase “the
survival of the fittest,” expresses this critical difficulty
as follows: “The law that each creature shall take the
benefits and the evils of its own nature has been the law
under which life has evolved thus far. Any arrangements
which, in a considerable degree, prevent superiority from
profiting by the rewards of superiority, or shield inferiority
from the evils it entails&mdash;any arrangements
which tend to make it as well to be inferior as to be
superior, are arrangements diametrically opposed to the
progress of organisation, and the reaching of a higher
life.” This is permanently and necessarily true, and in
our care for childhood we have to reckon with it. Yet
even Spencer himself did not pursue this supremely
important enquiry to what I shall in a moment submit
to be its logical and almost incredibly hopeful conclusion.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p_26" id="p_26">[26]</a></span></p>
<p>Huxley, writing his well-known Romanes Lecture,
“Evolution and Ethics,” at a time when, unfortunately,
he had somewhat parted company with Spencer, and
was too ready to accept any argument that made against
Spencer's political views, cuts the Gordian knot in an
astonishingly unsatisfactory fashion. He declares that
“the ethical progress of society depends, not on imitating
the cosmic process [that is, the selection of the fittest],
still less in running away from it, but in combating it.”
This is shallow thinking and very poor philosophy. One
wonders how Huxley can have forgotten the great dictum
of Bacon that Nature can be commanded only by obeying
her. He declares that moral evolution is the direct
contradiction and antithesis of the process of organic
evolution hitherto. He says, “Social progress means a
checking of the cosmic process at every step and the
substitution for it of another, which may be called the
ethical process;” and he declares it to be a fallacy to
suppose “that because on the whole animals and plants
have advanced in perfection of organisation, by means of
the struggle for existence and the consequent survival
of the fittest; therefore men in society, men as ethical
beings, must look to the same process to help them
towards perfection.”</p>

<p>With all this Huxley offers us no real solution whatever,
no hint that he has realised in any degree what must be
the consequences of indiscriminate survival. It is astonishing
how personal bias, so alien to the whole character
of the man as a rule, blinded him to a solution which, as
it seems to me, stared him in the face. Assuredly we can
transmute and elevate and raise to its highest power what
he calls the cosmic process, and can reconcile cosmic with
ethical evolution, <i>by extending to the unfit all our sympathy
but forbidding them parenthood</i>. I deny that the provision
of a proper environment for the individual entails racial<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_27" id="p_27">[27]</a></span>
deterioration. Cosmic and moral evolution are compatible
if, whilst caring for each individual, whether maim,
halt, blind, or insane, and whilst admitting the categorical
imperative of the law of love which demands our care for
him, we continue to obey the indication of Nature, which
forbids such an individual to perpetuate his infirmity.
Nature has no choice; if she is to avert the coming of the
unfit race she must summarily extinguish its potential
ancestor, but we can prohibit the reproduction of his
infirmity whilst doing all we can for the success of his
individual life. This is the ideal course indicated and
approved by biology and morality alike.</p>

<p><em class="psection">The eugenic reconciliation.</em>&mdash;I submit, then, that there
is no inconsistency in fighting simultaneously for the
preservation and care of all babies and all children without
discrimination of any kind&mdash;and, on the other hand,
in declaring that, if the degeneration of the race is to be
averted, still more if racial, which is the only sure, progress,
is to be attained, we must have the worthy and only the
worthy to be the parents of the future. I submit further
that only the eugenist can maintain his position in this
matter at the present day.</p>

<p>On his one hand is the improvident humanitarian with
his feeling heart, he who, seeing misery and disease and
death, whether in babyhood, childhood, or at any other
time of life, seeks to improve the environment and so
relieve these evils. Close beside this wholly indiscriminate
humanitarianism is that which declares that
with childhood is the future and therefore devotes its
energies especially to the young, is grateful for every baby
born, whatever its state, and when adult years are reached,
assumes that all will be well for the future, though the
principle of natural selection is thus made of none effect.</p>

<p>On the other side of the eugenists stand those whom
we may for short call the Nietzscheans. They see<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_28" id="p_28">[28]</a></span>
one-half of the truth of natural selection; they see that
through struggle and internecine war, species have
hitherto maintained themselves or ascended. They declare
that all improvement of the environment, or at any
rate all humanitarian effort, tends to abrogate the struggle
for existence, and even, as is only too often true, to select
unworth and let worth go to the wall. This school then
declares that infant mortality is a blessing and charity
an unmitigated curse. In short, that we must go back
as quickly as possible to the order of the beast.</p>

<p>Between these two, surely, the eugenist stands, declaring
that each has a great truth, but that his teaching,
and his alone, involves their co-ordination and reconciliation.
He agrees with the humanitarian that no child
should cry or starve or work or die&mdash;or at any rate this
particular eugenist does&mdash;and he agrees with the Nietzschean
that to abrogate, and still more, to reverse, the
principle of natural selection, is to set our faces for the goal
of racial death. But further, the eugenist declares that the
indiscriminate humanitarian, blind to the truth which the
Nietzschean sees, would heap up, if permitted, disaster
upon disaster; whilst he repudiates as horrible and
ghastly the Nietzschean doctrine that morality must go
by the board if the race is to be raised:&mdash;that we must be
damned to be saved.</p>

<p>Our age is now awakening, at last, to the cry of the
children. The tendency of legislation and opinion in
every civilised country is one and the same. For this
humanitarianism let only him who thinks of any child
as a brat refuse to give thanks. But it is the business
of all who, whilst loving children and still in love with
love, are yet acquainted with the principles of organic
evolution&mdash;in short, the business of all humane men
of science, men of science who have not ceased to be
human&mdash;whilst aiding, abetting and directing this<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_29" id="p_29">[29]</a></span>
humanitarian effort by every means in their power, to
teach and preach, in season and out of season, that
unless meanwhile we make terms with the principle of
selection, the choice of worth for parents, and the
rejection of the unworthy, <i>not as individuals but as
parents</i>, we shall assuredly breed for posterity, whose
lives and happiness and moral welfare are in our hands,
evils that can adequately neither be named nor numbered.
Already, together with much blessed good, this indiscriminate
humanitarianism has done much evil. Many
of our most instant and, for this generation, insoluble
problems are the lamentable fruit of this inherently
good thing. The eugenist declares that this fruit is not
necessary, that if it were necessary he could see no way
out of our morass and would echo the half-wish of Huxley
for some kindly comet that should put a term to human
history altogether; and, in short, that only by the
eugenic means can the humanitarian end be attained.</p>

<p>During the last year or two of the campaign against
infant mortality many things have become clear, and
none clearer than the fundamental compatibility between
this campaign and the principles of eugenics. As these
two efforts wall be predominant in the real politics of
all the years to come, a few more words must here be
devoted to the relation between them.</p>

<p>Granted that the highest of all objects is the making
of worthy human beings, it is quite evident that we
must attend equally to the two factors which determine
all human life&mdash;heredity and environment. Eugenics
stands for the principle of heredity&mdash;the principle that
the right children shall be born. The campaign against
infant mortality stands for a good environment<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>&mdash;so<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_30" id="p_30">[30]</a></span>
that children, when born, may survive and thrive.
Obviously eugenics would be of no use if the children
could not survive, and no human infant can survive
unless it be born into a moral environment: no motherhood,
no man. The two campaigns, then, are strictly
complementary. We must endeavour to rid ourselves
of the popular notion that the whole result of the campaign
against infant mortality can be measured by the
number of babies whose death is prevented. The infant
mortality is merely an index of a widespread social
disease&mdash;an index and an extreme symptom. But for
every baby killed many are damaged; and to remove
the causes of infant mortality is to remove the causes
which at present effect the deterioration of millions of
human beings. The eugenic campaign, then, without
the other would be almost futile.</p>

<p><em class="psection">The time for eugenics.</em>&mdash;On our principles the eugenic
question can be decently raised only <i>before conception</i>. The
unyoked germ-cells of any individual, though alive, are not
entitled to claim protection from the principle that life is
sacred. It is permitted to allow them to die; but from
the moment of conception a new individual has been formed&mdash;a
new living human individual, even though it only consists
of a single cell, product of the union of the parental
germ-cells: and we shall not be safe unless we regard
this being as sacred and its destruction&mdash;except in order
to save the life of the mother&mdash;as murder, even at
this as at any later stage. If the eugenist should raise
his voice, and say that this individual should not be born,
he must be regarded exactly as if he were to recommend
infanticide or the lethal chamber for unfit individuals.
In such a case he would have entirely mistaken the
whole principle of (negative) eugenics, which is <i>not</i> to
elevate the race by the destruction of the unfit, at
any stage, ante-natal or post-natal, but to do so by<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_31" id="p_31">[31]</a></span>
prohibiting the conception of the unfit. Directly the new
human individual is formed the eugenic question is too
late in that case. It is now the eugenist's duty, because it
is every one's duty, to regard the new individual, whether
born or yet unborn, as an end in himself or herself. But
when the question arises whether that individual is to
become a parent, then the eugenic question can and
must be raised.</p>

<p>Circumstances might arise in which “case-law” might
be applicable. It might be thought better to destroy
the syphilitic child rather than allow it to come into
the world. But we cannot make these distinctions.
The question is simply one of expediency, and the
only expedient thing is that there shall be no paltering
with the principle that when a new human life is conceived
our duty is to preserve it, whether it were conceived
only twenty-four hours ago or whether it be a decrepit
and helpless centenarian. The instant we let this principle
go we are proposing to revert to Nature's method of keeping
up the level of a race by murder. It is improper, then, for
any one on eugenic grounds to protest against proposals
for the arrest of infant mortality. He should have
spoken sooner; at this stage he must hold his peace.</p>

<p><em class="psection">The two campaigns complementary.</em>&mdash;Yet further:
not only is it evident that the campaign against
infant mortality (which is, in a word, the campaign
for the provision of a proper environment for the
young) is obviously necessary for the fulfilment of the
eugenic ideal&mdash;since what would be the good of choosing
the right parents if their children are then to be slain?&mdash;but
it can be shown conversely that the object of those
who are working against infant mortality can never be fully
attained except by means of eugenics. Eugenics apart,
we can and shall reduce the infant mortality to a mere fraction
of what it is at present, by preventing the destruction<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_32" id="p_32">[32]</a></span>
of that great majority of babies who are born healthy.
Even, however, when we have provided an ideal environment
for every baby that comes into the world, we shall
not have abolished infant mortality, since there will
always remain a proportion, say ten per cent., whom
not even an ideal environment can save. They should
never have been conceived. At the Infantile Mortality
Conference held in London in 1908, this was clearly
recognised by more than one speaker. The maternalist
must have the eugenist to help him if his ideal is to be
attained.</p>

<p>Not only is the ideal of the two campaigns one and
the same; not only is each necessary for the other, but
their methods are the same. It is true that at first
this was not evident, since when we began to fight against
infant mortality many temporary expedients of no
eugenic relevance were adopted, such as the <i>crèche</i> and
the infant milk depot. But in the interval between the
Conferences of 1906 and 1908 many things became
clear: so that, whereas the papers at the first Conference
were only accidentally connected, the programme of the
second proceeded upon a principle&mdash;the principle of
the supremacy of motherhood. We see now that the
one fundamental method by which infantile mortality
may be checked is by the elevation of motherhood. In
the words of our President, Mr. John Burns, “you must
glorify, dignify, and purify motherhood by every means
in your power.” Thus the first two papers read at
the first morning's meeting of the Conference&mdash;a brief
paper by the present writer on “The Human Mother,”
and an admirable paper by Miss Alice Ravenhill on
“Education for Motherhood”&mdash;might equally well
have been read at a Eugenics Conference. The opponent
of infant mortality and the eugenist appeal to the same
principle and avow the same creed: that parenthood is<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_33" id="p_33">[33]</a></span>
sacred, that it must not be casually undertaken, that it
demands the most assiduous preparation of body and
intellect and emotions. When, at last, these principles
are believed and acted upon, infant mortality will be
a thing of the past and national eugenics a thing of the
present.</p>

<p>It is essential in this first general study of the subject
to state the true nature of the relation between these
two campaigns, to which every succeeding year of the
present century will find more and more attention devoted.
Between them they succeed in beginning at the beginning,
and it would be a disaster, indeed, if they were incompatible.
On the contrary, they are complementary and
mutually indispensable. As the years go on they will
engage between them the sympathy and the assistance
of all serious people. In the year 1907 infant mortality
was first named in a speech by a Prime Minister, and in
that same year it was first mentioned in the Christmas-Day
sermon at St. Paul's Cathedral; in that year also
Parliament passed the Early Notification of Births Act,
the first substantial legislative provision which sets our
feet on the road towards the goal of a true national
estimate of the value of parenthood. We are about to
discover that the true politics is domestics, since there
is no wealth but life and life begins at home. We are
going to have the right kind of life born, and we are going
to take care of it when it is born. We shall raise a
generation which looks upon the ordinary money-changing
politician as an impudent public nuisance, and the brutal,
blood-stained Imperialist, shouting about the Empire
which his very existence almost suffices to condemn, whilst
he battens on the cannibal sale of alcoholic poison to babies
and the mothers of future babies, as the very type of those
traitors&mdash;they of its own household&mdash;who have helped to
destroy every Empire in history. We propose to rebuild<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_34" id="p_34">[34]</a></span>
the living foundations of empire. To this end we shall
preach a New Imperialism, warning England to beware
lest her veins become choked with yellow dirt, and demanding
that over all her legislative chambers there be
carved the more than golden words, “There is no Wealth
but Life.”</p>

<p>Before looking more closely than we are commonly
apt to do at the meaning of the phrases “natural selection”
and “survival of the fittest,” let us exercise the
right of man the moral being, as distinguished from
man the scientist or observer of Nature, to pass ethical
judgments upon the facts which it is the business of
all the sciences, except ethics itself, merely to record
and interpret in and for themselves. We are beginning
at last, half a century after the publication of the <i>Origin
of Species</i> in 1859, to realise the power of the law of
selection; what is the moral judgment which is to be
passed upon it? In a passage from the last page of
Herbert Spencer's Autobiography, we find words which
may be quoted on both sides: “When we think of the
myriads of years of the Earth's past, during which have
arisen and passed away low forms of creatures, small
and great, which, <i>murdering and being murdered, have
gradually evolved</i>,<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> how shall we answer the question&mdash;To
what end?”</p>

<p>“Murdering and being murdered” suggests the adverse,
and “have gradually evolved,” the favourable, ethical
judgment.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p_36" id="p_36">[36]</a></span></p>
<p>Many thinkers, finding Nature “so careless of the
single life,” finding the murderous struggle for existence
the dominant fact of the history of the living world,
return an adverse verdict. Amongst them are to be
found not merely those who are inclined, by temperament
or imperfect education, to rebellion against any conclusions
of science, but also, as we saw in the second
chapter, such a great biologist as Huxley. In another
part of the lecture already cited he says that the Stoics
failed to see</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“... that cosmic nature is no school of virtue, but the headquarters
of the enemy of ethical nature. The logic of facts was
necessary to convince them that the cosmos works through the
lower nature of man, not for righteousness, but against it....
The practice of that which is ethically best&mdash;what we call goodness
or virtue&mdash;involves a course of conduct which, in all respects,
is opposed to that which leads to success in the cosmic struggle for
existence.”</p></div>

<p>In other words, honesty is the <i>worst</i> policy: and to
worship natural selection is to deify the devil.</p>

<p>The reader will realise that, if we are to succeed in
establishing the claim of natural selection to be the
natural model upon which those who desire the progress
of society are to base their policy, it is necessary to controvert
the doctrine that natural selection is an anti-moral
process. But let us hear the other side.</p>

<p>The directly contrary view, then, is taken that though,
truly enough, there has been and is much “murdering
and being murdered,” yet organisms “have gradually
evolved” towards fitness for their surroundings, or the
<i>milieu environnant</i> of Lamarck, which we translate environment;
and that since fitness or adaptation obviously
makes for happiness, and since the moral being man
has himself been thus evolved, the process of natural
selection, “murdering and being murdered” notwithstanding,
is essentially beneficent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p_37" id="p_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>The controversy is embittered and complicated by the
fact that ultimate questions of religion and philosophy
are involved. Is the Universe moral, as Emerson asserted
it was, or is it immoral? A recent opponent of the
orthodox creed of a benevolent Deity teaches that “The
Lesson of Evolution” is to disprove the idea of benevolence
behind or in Nature: “The story of life has been a story
of pain and cruelty of the most ghastly description.”
The age-long fact of “murdering and being murdered”
is the weapon with which he attacks the theist: who,
<i>per contra</i>, points to the beneficent result, the exquisite
adaptation of all species to the circumstances of their
life, and the evolution of love itself.</p>

<p>We may remind ourselves of those great lines of
Mr. George Meredith,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">“... sure reward<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We have whom knowledge crowns;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who see in mould the rose unfold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>The soul through blood and tears</i>.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The one camp points to the “blood and tears” and
asks for a verdict accordingly. The other points to
“the soul” as their product, and asks for a verdict
accordingly. But surely we need only to have the
case fairly stated, in order to realise that the “blood
and tears” are true but only half the truth, “the soul”
true but only half the truth. Natural Selection is a
colossal paradox&mdash;the doing evil that good may come.
The evil is undoubtedly done, and the good undoubtedly
comes. Is not this the only verdict that is in consonance
with all the facts? Is it not less than philosophic to
look at the process alone, or to look at the result alone?
Is any real end to be served by the incessant cry that
we should keep our eyes fixed on the “blood and tears”
alone, or on “the soul” alone? Is not the poet right
when he says that the sure reward of knowledge is not to<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_38" id="p_38">[38]</a></span>
see either half of the truth as if it were the whole, but
to see unfold “the soul through blood and tears?”</p>

<p>Any attempt to cast up accounts between the evil of
the process and the good of the result&mdash;especially any
attempt based on the assumption that the process has
yet achieved its final result&mdash;would be not only premature
in the eyes of those who can look forwards, but
would be irrelevant to our present enquiry. I certainly am
with those who repudiate as misleading Mill's description
of Nature as a “vast slaughter-house,” and will declare
that, apart from self-conscious and supremely sensitive
man, it is easy to exaggerate the misery and to minimise
the joy of the sub-human world. But our business here
is with the process and its results in man himself, in
whom alone are possible the heights of ecstasy and the
depths of agony: and the thesis&mdash;the sublime thesis, we
may avouch&mdash;of the present discussion is that, whatever
the balance between the evil of the process of Natural
Selection and the good of its results in the natural state, yet
when it is transmuted, as it may be, by the moral intelligence
of man, according to the principles of race-culture
or eugenics, the good of the result can be attained, more
abundantly and incomparably more rapidly, than ever
heretofore, <i>whilst the evil of the process can be abolished
altogether</i>. True or false, is this not a sublime thesis?</p>

<p><em class="psection">Nature must be cruel to be kind.</em>&mdash;If organic fitness
or adaptation to the circumstances of life is to be secured,
Nature must choose for future parents, out of every new
generation, only those whose inborn characters make for
this adaptation, and who, in virtue of the fact we call
heredity, will tend to transmit this fitness to their offspring.
Now it is often convenient to personify Nature,
but we must not be misled. The process is really an
automatic, not an intelligently directed one. In order
that it shall be possible, certain conditions must obtain.<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_39" id="p_39">[39]</a></span>
The choice or selection depends not merely upon the
provision of a variety from which to choose&mdash;this being
afforded by what is called variation, which is the correlative
of heredity, both being obvious facts in any well-filled
nursery&mdash;but also upon the production of <i>more</i>
young creatures than there is or will be room for. (If
there be room for all, so that all survive, there can be
no selection, and instead of survival of the fittest there
will be indiscriminate survival.) The choice is effected
amongst this superfluity by an internecine “struggle for
existence”: hence the “murdering and being murdered,”
hence the “blood and tears.” The motor force of the
whole process may be symbolised as the “will to life,”
ever seeking to realise itself in more abundance and with
more success&mdash;with more and more approximation to
perfect adaptation. The will to death is no ingredient
of the will to life. Nature is, so to say, by no means
desirous of the process of “murdering and being murdered”:
very much on the contrary. It is life, more
life, and fitter life, that is her desire: the “murdering
and being murdered,” the “blood and tears” are no
part of her aim. But they are inevitable, though lamentable,
if her aim is to be realised. She <i>must</i> be cruel to
be kind&mdash;a little cruel to be very kind.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p_40" id="p_40">[40]</a></span></p>
<p>It is <i>imaginable</i>, though no more, that natural selection,
in certain circumstances, might have worked otherwise:
the penalty for less as against greater fitness might
<i>imaginably</i> have been not death but merely sterility&mdash;the
denial of future parenthood. This is the ideal of race-culture.
Had this been possible, Nature could have
effected her end, which is fitter and fuller life, without
having incidentally to mete out premature death to such
an overwhelming majority of all her creatures. But,
actually, this was not possible: and, unless the end was
to be sacrificed, Nature was compelled&mdash;to keep up the
figure&mdash;summarily to kill right and left. Permitted to
reach maturity, the unfit as well as the fit would multiply;
and since, in general, the lower the form of life the greater
its fertility, the species could not possibly advance, or even
maintain itself at the level already gained.</p>

<p>To drop the figure, the process is a mechanical and
automatic one, and its appalling wastefulness and indisputable
cruelty are inevitably involved, whilst it so
remains.</p>

<p><em class="psection">Intelligence may be kind to be kinder.</em>&mdash;But&mdash;and
here is the great event&mdash;this mechanical, automatic, non-intelligent
process has latterly given birth to intelligence,
the moral intelligence of man: and the question now
to be answered is, what modification can intelligence
effect in the moral-immoral process that has created
it? Must intelligence abrogate that process altogether,
as Huxley declares, on the grounds of its
murderous methods? Must intelligence simply look on,
recognise, but not reconstruct? Must intelligence reverse
the process&mdash;as indeed it is now doing in many
cases&mdash;so that in the new environment of which itself is
a factor, that which formerly was unfitness shall become
fitness, and <i>vice versâ</i>? <i>Or</i> is it conceivable that intelligence
can transmute the process, so that, whilst hitherto<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_41" id="p_41">[41]</a></span>
mechanical, automatic, and therefore inevitably murderous,
it shall become <i>intelligent</i>, pressing towards the
sublime end, and reforming the murderous means?</p>

<p>Hear Mr. Galton himself (<i>Sociological Papers</i>, 1905,
p. 52):&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Purely passive, or what may be styled mechanical evolution,
displays the awe-inspiring spectacle of a vast eddy of organic
turmoil ... it is moulded by blind and wasteful processes,
namely, by an extravagant production of raw material and the
ruthless rejection of all that is superfluous, through the blundering
steps of trial and error.... Evolution is in any case a grand
phantasmagoria, but it assumes an infinitely more interesting
aspect under the knowledge that the intelligent action of the
human will is, in some small measure, capable of directing its
course. Man has the power of doing this largely so far as the
evolution of humanity is concerned; he has already affected the
quality and distribution of organic life so widely that the changes
on the surface of the earth, merely through his disforestings and
agriculture, would be recognisable from a distance as great as that
of the moon.”</p></div>

<p>Hear also Sir E. Ray Lankester, in the Romanes
Lecture<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> for 1905: “Man is ... a product of the definite
and orderly evolution which is universal, a being
resulting from and driven by the one great nexus of
mechanism which we call Nature. He stands alone,
face to face with that relentless mechanism. It is his
destiny to understand and to control it.”</p>

<p>“Nature's insurgent son,” Professor Lankester calls man
in this lecture: and yet again there recurs that mighty
aphorism of Bacon, which might well be printed on every
page of these chapters, “Nature is to be commanded only
by obeying her.” The struggle for existence is the
terrible fact of Nature, but is only a means to an end.
It is our destiny to command the end whilst <i>humanising</i>
the means.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p_42" id="p_42">[42]</a></span></p>
<p><em class="psection">The struggle for existence.</em>&mdash;The ideal of eugenics or
race-culture is to abolish the brutal elements of the
struggle for existence whilst gaining its great end. The
nature of this struggle is commonly misapprehended and,
as I cannot improve upon the words of Professor
Lankester, I shall freely use them in the attempt to
show what it really is. He says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The world, the earth's surface, is practically full, that is to say,
fully occupied. Only one pair of young can grow up to take the
place of the pair&mdash;male and female&mdash;which have launched a
dozen, or it may be as many as a hundred thousand, young
individuals on the world.... The ‘struggle for existence’ of
Darwin is the struggle amongst all the superabundant young of a
given species, in a given area, to gain the necessary food, to escape
voracious enemies, and gain protection from excesses of heat, cold,
moisture, and dryness. One pair in the new generation&mdash;only one
pair&mdash;survive for every parental pair. Animal population does
not increase: ‘Increase and multiply’ has never been said by
Nature to her lower creatures. Locally, and from time to time,
owing to exceptional changes, a species may multiply here and
decrease there; but it is important to realise that the ‘struggle
for existence’ in Nature&mdash;that is to say, among the animals and
plants of this earth untouched by man&mdash;is a desperate one, however
tranquil and peaceful the battlefield may appear to us. The
struggle for existence takes place, not as a clever French writer
glibly informs his readers, between different species, but between
individuals of the same species, brothers and sisters and cousins....
In Nature's struggle for existence, death, immediate obliteration,
is the fate of the vanquished, whilst the only reward to the
victors&mdash;few, very few, but rare and beautiful in the fitness which
has carried them to victory&mdash;is the permission to reproduce their
kind&mdash;to carry on by heredity to another generation the specific
qualities by which they triumphed.</p>

<p>“It is not generally realised how severe is the pressure and
competition in Nature&mdash;not between different species, but between
the immature population of one and the same species, precisely
because they are of the same species and have exactly the same
needs.... A distinctive quality in the beauty of natural productions
(in which man delights) is due to the unobtrusive yet
tremendous slaughter of the unfit which is incessantly going on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_43" id="p_43">[43]</a></span>and the absolute restriction of the privilege of parentage to the
happy few who attain to the standard described as ‘the fittest.’”</p></div>

<p><em class="psection">The survival of the fittest.</em>&mdash;Now let us look closely at
this most famous of all Spencer's phrases, “the survival
of the fittest,” and try to understand its full and exact
meaning. There is no phrase in any language so frequently
misinterpreted. Even a writer who should know
better makes this mistake. Mr. H. G. Wells speaks<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
of “that same lack of a fine appreciation of facts that
enabled Herbert Spencer to coin those two most unfortunate
terms <i>Evolution</i> and the <i>Survival of the Fittest</i>.
The implication is that the <i>best</i> reproduces and survives.
Now really it is the <i>better</i> that survives and not the <i>best</i>.”
What the correction is supposed to signify I do not know,
but the whole passage is nonsense. The implication is
neither that the <i>best</i> nor the <i>better</i> survive, but the fittest&mdash;or
if Mr. Wells prefers, for it matters not one whit&mdash;the
fitter. This lack of a fine appreciation of words is not,
unfortunately, peculiar to Mr. Wells. There is no word
in the language that more exactly expresses the fact than
the word fittest: as Darwin recognised when he promptly
incorporated Spencer's phrase in the second edition of the
<i>Origin of Species</i> as the best interpretation of his own
phrase “natural selection”!<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Fitness is the capacity
to fit: a thing that is fit is a thing that <i>fits</i>. A living
creature survives in proportion as it fits its environment&mdash;the
physical environment in the case of vegetables and
the lower animals, the physical, social, intellectual and
moral environment in the case of man. The kind of
glove that most perfectly fits the hand is the fittest glove
<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_44" id="p_44">[44]</a></span>and will survive in the struggle for existence between
gloves. If, instead of a glove, we take a living creature,
say a microbe, the kind of microbe that best fits into the
environment provided by, say, human blood, is the fittest
and will survive and be the cause of our commonest
disease. Thus the tubercle bacillus is at once the <i>fittest</i>
microbe and, not the best, but the worst. Among
ourselves, the newspaper devoted to yesterday's murder
is the fittest and survives, ousting the newspaper which
reckons with the crucifixion, or the murder of Socrates or
Bruno. In a society of blackguardism, the biggest blackguard
is the fittest man and will survive: he is also the
worst. In another society the best man is the fittest and
survives. The capacity to fit into the environment is the
capacity that determines survival: it has no moral connotation
whatever. If Herbert Spencer had written the
survival of the better, as Mr. Wells desires, he would have
written palpable nonsense: as it was he used the fittest
word&mdash;in this case also the best, because the truest.
Referring to the queen-bee, who destroys her own
daughters, Darwin says, “undoubtedly this is for the good
of the community; maternal love or maternal hatred,
though the latter fortunately is most rare, is all the
same to the inexorable principle of natural selection.”</p>

<p>If natural selection were the survival of the better, as
Mr. Wells would have us believe, there would be nothing
for eugenics or race-culture to do: and heaven would
long ago have come to earth. If in all ages the better men
and women had survived and become parents, earth would
long ago have become a demi-paradise indeed, there would
have been no arrests, no reversals in the history of human
progress, and life would be already what, some day, it
will be, when there is achieved the eugenic ideal&mdash;which
is precisely that the best or better members of our
race shall be the selected for the supreme profession of<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_45" id="p_45">[45]</a></span>
parenthood. In other words, the eugenic ideal, the ideal
of race-culture, is <i>to ensure that the fittest shall be the best</i>.
Always, everywhere, without a solitary exception, human,
animal or vegetable, the fittest have ultimately survived
and must survive. Once realise what is the meaning of
the word fit&mdash;best seen in the verb “to fit”&mdash;and we
shall see that, as Herbert Spencer pointed out in his
overwhelming reply to the late Lord Salisbury's attack
on evolution, the idea of the survival of the fittest is a
necessity of thought.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>But, alas, the idea of the survival of the best or the
better is not a necessity of thought! The fittest microbes
are the worst from our point of view, because they are
most inimical to the highest forms of life; the fittest
newspaper may be the worst, because it panders to the
worst but most widespread and irresponsible elements
in human nature; everything and every one that succeeds,
succeeds because it or he fits the conditions: but
to succeed is not necessarily to be good. Indeed everything
that exists at all, living or lifeless, an atom or an
animal, a molecule or a moon, exists because it can exist,
because it fits the conditions of existence: there is no
moral question involved, but only a mechanical one.
The business of eugenics or race-culture is to make an
environment, conditions of law and public opinion, <i>such
that the fittest shall be the best and the best the fittest therein</i>.</p>

<p>If memory may be trusted, the primary meaning of the
word <i>fit</i> has not hitherto been called in by any one to
elucidate the meaning of Spencer's phrase: perhaps it
may be hoped that we shall at last begin to understand it,
if we remember that a thing is fit because it fits. It is
best not to be too sanguine, however, and therefore we
may attempt to illustrate the case from another aspect.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p_46" id="p_46">[46]</a></span></p>
<p><em class="psection">Survival-value.</em>&mdash;Every living thing and nearly every
character or feature of a living thing that survives, survives
because it has value or capacity for life&mdash;which may be
called, in Professor Lloyd Morgan's phrase, <i>survival-value</i>.
The character that gives an organism survival-value, or
value for life, the character that enables it to fit its environment,
may be of any order. The atom, as I have said
elsewhere, is an organism writ small. The kinds of atoms
that have survived in the age-long struggle for existence
between atoms are those that have survival-value on
account of their internal stability: as Empedocles argued
ages ago. In the case of living things, which individually
die, it is evident that the capacity to reproduce themselves
is one of supreme survival-value. If mankind
lost this capacity, all its other characters of survival-value,
such as intelligence, would obviously avail it
nought. Certain valuable members of society may fall
short in this cardinal respect, and therefore become
extinct. Indeed, other forms of survival-value, as we
shall see, seem to be in large measure inimical to fertility:
and this is perhaps the chief obstacle to eugenics.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>Fertility apart, the character having survival-value may
take a thousand forms. In the case of the parasitic
microbe it is an evil character, the power to produce
toxins or poisons. In the case of the tiger it is the possession
of large and powerful bones and claws and muscles
and teeth. In the case of the ox it is a complicated and
efficient digestive apparatus, enabling it to fit into a
food-environment which is too innutritious to sustain
the life of creatures not so endowed. Nature seeks only
the fittest; not the best but the best-adapted; she asks
no moral questions. A Keats, a Spinoza, or a Schubert
must go under if his factors of survival-value do not enable<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_47" id="p_47">[47]</a></span>
him to resist those of the tubercle bacillus, its toxins or
poisons. She welcomes the parasitic tapeworm, all hooks
and mouth or stomach, because these give it survival-value;
and so on.</p>

<p>The business of eugenics or race-culture, then, is to
create an environment such that those characters which
we desire as moral and intelligent beings shall be endowed
with the highest possible survival-value, as against those
which ally so many men with the microbe and the tapeworm.
There are those who live in society to-day, and
reproduce their like, in virtue of the poisons they produce,
in virtue of their tenacious hooks and voracious stomachs.
If society be organised so that these are factors of more
survival-value than the disinterested search for truth, or
mother-love, or the power to create great poetry or
music&mdash;then, according to the inevitable and universal
law of the survival of the fittest, our parasites will oust
our poets and our poisoners our philosophers. These
things have happened and may happen again at any time.
It does not matter that the good thing, in virtue of
survival-value then superior, has been evolved. Nature
never gives a final verdict in favour of good or bad but
only and always in favour of the fit. Let the conditions
change, so that rapacity fits them better than righteousness,
or&mdash;as in a completely “collectivist” state&mdash;vegetableness
rather than virility, and the thing we call
high will go under before the thing we call low. Nature
recognises neither high nor low but only fitness or value for
life in the conditions that actually obtain. These laws enthroned
and dethroned the civilisations of the past: they
have enthroned and may dethrone us. But this end is
not inevitable, since man&mdash;and this is his great character&mdash;not
merely reacts to his environment, as all creatures
must, but can create and recreate it. The business of
eugenics or race-culture is to create an environment such<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_48" id="p_48">[48]</a></span>
that the human characters of which the human spirit
approves shall in it outweigh those of which we disapprove.
Make it fittest to be best and the best will
win&mdash;not because it is the best, but because it is the
fittest: had the worst been the fittest it would have won.
In society to-day both forms of the process may be
observed. The balance between them determines its
destiny. It is the business of eugenics to throw the
whole weight of human purpose into the scale of the
good.</p>

<p><em class="psection">Evolution not necessarily progress.</em>&mdash;No excessive space
has been devoted to this distinction between the fittest
and the best and to the real meaning of Spencer's famous
phrase, if perchance it should avail in any degree to dispel
one of the commonest of the many common delusions
regarding the nature of organic evolution and its outcome.
This delusion is that progress is an inevitable law
of nature.<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> The great process of history, as revealed
by biology, displays as its supreme fact the occurrence
of progress. The principles of evolution teach that this
progress&mdash;as, for instance, in the evolution of man&mdash;is a
product of the survival of the fittest; whilst we are also
reminded that the survival of the fittest is a necessary
truth: but it does not follow that progress is inevitable.</p>

<p>In the first place, natural selection involves selection.
Where all the young members of a new generation of any
species survive, and parenthood becomes not a privilege
but a common and universal function, plainly the process
is in abeyance: and, in the second place, since the survival
of the fittest is not the survival of the best, but only
the survival of the best adapted, the process may at any
time take the form of retrogression rather than that of
progress. The assumption that, because progress has<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_49" id="p_49">[49]</a></span>
been effected through natural selection, we need do no
more than fold our hands, or unfold them merely to applaud,
involves the denial of one of the most familiar
facts of natural history&mdash;the fact of racial degeneration.
The parasitic microbes, the parasitic worms, the barnacles,
innumerable living creatures both animal and vegetable,
individuals and races of mankind, to-day as in all ages&mdash;these
prove only too clearly that the process of the
survival of the fittest may make as definitely for retrogression
in one case as for progress in another.</p>

<p>By all means let us infer from the facts of organic
evolution the conclusion that further progress must surely
be possible, so much progress having already been achieved
as is represented by the difference between inorganic
matter or the amœba or microbe on the one hand, and
man on the other hand. But let us most earnestly beware
of the false and disastrous optimism which should suppose
that because the survival of the fittest has often, and
indeed most often, meant the survival of the best, it
means always that and nothing else. On the contrary,
we must learn that, even in natural circumstances, apart
from any interference by man, the survival of the fittest
often means racial degeneration&mdash;a tapeworm kept in
spirits should stand upon the study mantelpiece of all
who think with Mr. Wells that the survival of the fittest
means the survival of the better; and still more notably
we must learn that the interference of man in the case
of his own species, sometimes of evil intent, sometimes
for the highest ends, with the process of natural selection,
has repeatedly led, and is now in large part leading, to
nothing other than that process of racial degeneration of
which the tapeworm and the barnacle should be our perpetual
reminders. The case becomes serious enough when
man interferes with the process of selection merely with the
effect of suspending it, wholly or in part: but it becomes<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_50" id="p_50">[50]</a></span>
far more serious when his interference constitutes a
reversal of the process. This most supremely disastrous
of all conceivable consequences of man's intelligence and
moral sense is known as reversed selection, and must be
carefully studied hereafter. Meanwhile, we must devote
some space to a most important consideration&mdash;namely,
that though Nature is impartial in her choice, and will,
for instance, allow the poisons of a microbe such as the
tubercle bacillus to destroy the life of a Spinoza or a
Keats or a Schubert, yet, on the whole, the survival-value
of the mental, spiritual, or psychical in all its forms
does persistently tend to outweigh that of the physical
or material&mdash;of this great truth the evolution and dominance
of man himself being the supreme example.</p>

<p>The very fact of progress, which I would define as the
emergence and increasing dominance of mind, demonstrates&mdash;it
being remembered that natural selection has no
moral prejudices&mdash;that even in a world of claws and
toxins the psychical must have possessed sufficient
survival-value to survive. It is quite evident that
even the lowliest psychical characters, such as sharpness
of sensation, discrimination, and memory, must be of
value in the struggle for life. More and more we might
expect to find, and do actually find in the course of
evolution, that creatures live by their wits, rather than by
force of bone or muscle. The psychical was certainly
given no unfair start&mdash;on the contrary. It has had to
struggle for its emergence; it has emerged only where
there has been struggle and has done so because it could&mdash;because
of its superior survival-value. It has the right
which belongs to might&mdash;in the world of life there is no
other.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p_51" id="p_51">[51]</a></span></p>
<p>By no means less evident is the inherently superior
survival-value of the psychical, if we turn from its aspects
of sensation and intelligence to those which are all summed
up under the word love. Notwithstanding Nietzsche's
mad misconception of the Darwinian theory, no one who
has studied the facts of reproduction and its conditions
in the world of life can question the incalculable survival-value
of love in animal history. The success of those
most ancient of all societies, of which the ant-heap and
the bee-hive are the types, depends absolutely upon the
self-sacrifice of the individual. If we pass upwards
from the insects to the lowest vertebrates, we find the
survival-value of love proved by the comparison between
various species of fish, and its increasing importance may
be traced upwards through amphibia, reptiles, birds and
mammals in succession, up to man. Natural selection
thus actually selects morality. Without love no baby
could live for twenty-four hours. Every human being
that exists or ever has existed or ever will exist is a
product of mother-love or foster-mother-love, and I
am well entitled to say, as I have so often said, <i>no morals,
no man</i>. The creature in whom organic morality is at
its height has become the lord of the earth in virtue of
that morality which natural selection has selected, not
from any moral bias, but because of its superior survival-value.</p>

<p>Whereas, in its beginning, <i>mind</i>, or the psychical in all
its aspects, was merely a useful property of <i>body</i>, all
organic progress may be conceived in terms of a change
in this original relation between them. In man, the
mental or psychical has become the essential thing, and
the body its servant. We are well prepared, then, to
accept the proposition that in our own day and for our
own species, the plane upon which natural selection
works has largely been transferred, and, indeed, if any
further progress is to be effected, <i>must</i> be transferred,
from the bodily or physical to the mental or psychical. A
certain most remarkable fact in the anatomy of man
may be cited, as we shall see, in support of this proposition.</p>

<p>We need not venture upon the controversial ground
of the relation or ultimate unity of mind and body;
nor need we set up any suggestion of antagonism between
them. All, however, are absolutely agreed that the
psychical in all its forms, whatever it really be, has a
consistent relation of the most intimate kind with that
part of the body which we call the nervous system.<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_53" id="p_53">[53]</a></span>
For our present purposes the nature of this relation
matters nothing at all, and in place of the phrase, the
“selection of mind,” I should be quite content, if the
reader so prefers, to speak of the selection of nerve or
nervous selection. And if I may for a moment anticipate
the conclusion, we may say that, in and for the future,
the process of selection for life and parenthood, as it occurs
in mankind, must be based, if the highest results are to
be obtained, upon the principle that the selection of
bodily qualities other than those of the nervous system
is of value only in so far as these serve the nervous or
psychical qualities. For practical and for theoretical
purposes we must accept the dictum of Professor Forel
that “the brain is the man”&mdash;or, to be more accurate
and less epigrammatic, the nervous system is the man.
If, then, we counsel or approve of any selection of bone
or muscle or digestion, or any other bodily organ or
function; if we select for physical health, physical
energy, longevity, or immunity from disease&mdash;our estimate
of these things, one and all, must be wholly determined
by the services which they can perform for the nervous
system, whether as its instruments, its guarantors of
health and persistence, or otherwise. But we are not
to regard any of these things as ends in themselves&mdash;notwithstanding
the fact that this temptation will constantly
beset us. So to do is implicitly to deny and
renounce the supreme character of man&mdash;which is that,
in him, mind or nervous system is the master, and the
rest of the body, with all its attributes, the servant.</p>

<p><em class="psection">The body still necessary.</em>&mdash;Should anyone suppose that
the principles here laid down would speedily involve us, if
executed, in a host of disasters, let him reconsider that
conclusion. Utterly ignorant or jocose persons have
hinted, more or less definitely, that if a race of mankind
were to be bred for brains, the product would be a most<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_54" id="p_54">[54]</a></span>
misbegotten creature approaching as near as possible&mdash;and
that imperfectly enough&mdash;to the ideal of disembodied
thought, a creature monstrous as to head, impotent and
puny as to limbs, and, in effect, the least effective of living
creatures. This supposition may be commended as the last
word in the way of nonsense. It depends upon an abysmal
ignorance of the necessary and permanent relations
which subsist between mind and body. It assumes that
the healthy mind can be obtained without the healthy
body; it is totally unaware that the nervous system
cannot work properly unless the blood be well aerated
by active lungs and distributed by a healthy heart;
that unless certain glands, of which these people have
never heard, are acting properly, the nervous system
falls into decadence, and the man becomes an imbecile.
To breed for brains is most assuredly to breed for body
too: only that the end in view will guide us as to what
points of body to breed for. For instance, it would
prevent us from having any foolish ambitions as to
increasing the stature of the race, or the average weight
of its muscular apparatus. Stature may be a point
to breed for in the race-culture of giraffes and muscle
in the race-culture of the hippopotamus: but such
bodily characters are of no moment for man, who is above
all things a mind. Whilst we shall pay little attention
to these, we or our descendants will be abundantly
concerned with the preservation and culture of those
many bodily characters upon which the health and
vigour and sanity and durability of the nervous system
depend.</p>

<p>Further, notwithstanding all the nonsense that has
been written concerning the man of the future, with bald
and swollen head, be-goggled eyes, toothless gums, and
wicker-work skeleton, those who know the alphabet
of physiology and psychology are warranted in believing<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_55" id="p_55">[55]</a></span>
that wisely to breed for brains will be to breed for beauty
too&mdash;not of the skin-deep but of the mind-deep variety&mdash;and
also for grace and energy and versatility of physique.
Those who worship brawn as brawn may be commended
to the ox; those who respect brawn as the instrument
of brain, and value it not by its horse-power but by
its capacity as the agent of purpose, will find nothing
to complain of in the kinds of men and women whom a
wise eugenics has for its ideal.</p>

<p><em class="psection">The erect attitude.</em>&mdash;And now we must briefly consider
that “most remarkable fact in the anatomy of man” to
which allusion was made in the first paragraph. It is that,
as the most philosophic anatomists are now coming to
believe, the body of man actually represents the goal of
physical evolution. Of course the common opinion is, quite
apart from science, that man is the highest of creatures,
and that there is no more to be expected. But the
doctrine of evolution regards man as the latest, not
necessarily the last, term in an age-long process
which is by no means completed, and from the
evolutionary point of view it is thus a daring
and, at first hearing, a preposterous thing to say that,
so far as the physical aspects of organic evolution are
concerned, the body of man apparently represents the
logical and final conclusion of the age-long process which
has produced it. Let us attempt very briefly to outline
the argument.</p>

<p>We may say that a great step was taken when from
the chaos of the invertebrate or backbone-less animals
there emerged the first vertebrates. This unquestionably
occurred in the sea, the first backbone being evolved
in a fish-like creature which, in the course of time, developed
two lateral fins. These became modified into
two pairs of limbs, the sole function of which was locomotion.
In the next group of vertebrates, the amphibia&mdash;such<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_56" id="p_56">[56]</a></span>
as the frog&mdash;we see these limbs terminating
each in five digits. (The frog, so to say, decided that we
should count in tens.) Now some creatures have
specialised their limbs at the cost of certain fingers.
The horse, for instance, walks on the nails (the hoofs)
of its middle fingers and its middle toes. In the
main line of ascent, however, none of these precious
fingers (and toes)&mdash;how precious let the typist or the
pianist say&mdash;have been sacrificed. There has been,
however, in later ages a tendency towards the specialisation
of the front limbs. Used for locomotion at times,
they are also used for grasping and tearing and holding,
as in the case of the tiger, a member of the carnivora,
a relatively late and high group of mammals. But the
carnivore does not carry its food to its mouth, and the
cat carries her kittens in her mouth and not with her
paws. In the apes and monkeys, however, this specialisation
goes further, and things are actually carried by the
hands to the mouth&mdash;a very great advance on the tiger,
who fixes his food with his “hands,” and then carries
his mouth to it. Food to mouth instead of mouth to
food is a much later stage in evolution, a fact which may
be recalled when we watch the table manners of certain
people. Finally, in man the specialisation reaches its
natural limit by the <i>complete</i> liberation of the fore-limbs
from the purposes of locomotion&mdash;though the crawling
gait of a child recalls the base degrees by which we did
ascend.</p>

<p>This great change depends upon an alteration
in the axis of the body. The first fishes, like present
fishes, were horizontal animals, but gradually the axis
has become altered, in the main line of progress, until
the semi-erect apes yield to man the erect, or “man the
erected,” as Stevenson called him. The son of horizontal
animals, he is himself vertical: the <span class="pagenum"><a name="p_57" id="p_57">[57]</a></span>“pronograde”
has become “orthograde.” Thus the phrase, “the
ascent of man,” may be read in two senses. This capital
fact has depended upon a shifting of the centre of
gravity of the body, which in adult man lies behind
the hip-joints, whereas in his ancestors and in the small
baby (still in the four-footed stage) it lies in front of the
hip-joints. Thus, whilst other creatures tend naturally
to fall forwards, so that they must use their fore-limbs
for support and locomotion, the whole body of man above
the hip-joints tends naturally to fall backwards, being
prevented from doing so by two great ligaments which
lie in front of the hip-joints and have a unique development
in man. The complete erection of the spine means
that the skull, instead of being suspended in front, is
now poised upon the top of the spinal column. The field
of vision is enormously enlarged, and it is possible to
sweep a great extent of horizon at a moment's notice.
But the complete discharge of the fore-limbs from the
function of locomotion has far vaster consequences,
especially as they now assume the function of educating
their master, the brain, and enabling him to employ them
for higher and higher purposes.</p>

<p>Thus, when we ask ourselves whether there is any
further goal for physical evolution, the answer is that
none can be seen. So far as physical evolution is concerned
the goal has been attained with the erect attitude.
Future changes in the anatomy of man will not be positive
but negative. There doubtless will be a certain lightening
of the ship, the casting overboard of inherited superfluities,
but that is all: except that we may hope for
certain modifications in the way of increasing the adaptation
of the body to the erect attitude, which at present
bears very hardly in many ways upon the body of man,
and much more so upon the body of woman.</p>

<p>Thus race-culture will certainly not aim at the breeding<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_58" id="p_58">[58]</a></span>
of physical freaks of any kind, nor yet at such things
as stature. It must begin by clearly recognising what
are the factors which in man possess supreme survival-value,
and it must aim at their reinforcement rather
than at the maintenance of those factors which, of
dominant value in lower forms of life, have been superseded
in him. A few words will suffice to show in what
fashion man has already shed vital characters which,
superfluous and burdensome for him, have in former
times been of the utmost survival-value.</p>

<p><em class="psection">The denudation of man.</em>&mdash;As contrasted with the
whole mass of his predecessors, man comes into the
world denuded of defensive armour, destitute of offensive
weapons, possessed alone of the potentialities
of the psychical. So far as defence is concerned,
he has neither fur nor feathers nor scales, but is the
most naked and thinnest skinned of animals. In his
<i>Autobiography</i>, Spencer tells us how he and Huxley,
sitting on the cliff at St. Andrews and watching some
boys bathing, “marvelled over the fact, seeming especially
strange when they are no longer disguised by clothes,
that human beings should dominate over all other creatures
and play the wonderful part they do on the earth.”<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
But man is not only without armour against either
living enemies or cold; he is also without weapons of
attack. His teeth are practically worthless in this
respect, not only on account of their small size but also
because his chin, a unique possession, and the shape
of his jaws, make them singularly unfit for catching
or grasping. For claws he has merely nails, capable
only of the feeblest scratching; he can discharge no<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_59" id="p_59">[59]</a></span>
poisons from his mouth; he cannot envelop himself in
darkness in order to hide himself; his speediest and
most enduring runner is a breathless laggard. And,
lastly, he is at first almost bereft of instinct, has to be
burnt in order to dread the fire, and cannot find his
own way to the breast. His sole instrument of dominance
is his mind in all its attributes.</p>

<p>On the grounds thus indicated, we must be wholly
opposed to all proposals for race education and race-culture,
and to all social practices, which assume more
or less consciously that, for all his boasting, man is after
all only an animal: whilst we must applaud the selection
and culture of the physical exactly in so far as, but no
further than, it makes for health and strength of the
psychical&mdash;or, if the reader dislikes these expressions,
the health and strength of that particular part of the
physical which we call the nervous system.</p>

<p>It used to be generally asserted that whilst, in a civilised
community, we do not expect to find the biggest or most
muscular man King or Prime Minister, yet amongst savage
tribes it <i>is</i> the physical, muscle and bone and brutality,
that determines leadership. This, however, we now
know to be untrue even for the earliest stages of society
that anthropologists can recognise. The leader of the
savage tribe is not the biggest man but the cleverest.
The suggestion is therefore that, even in the earliest stages
of human society, the plane of selection has already been
largely transferred from brawn to brain or from physique
to <i>psyche</i>. It has always been so, we may be well sure.
The Drift men of Taubach, living in the inter-glacial
period, could kill the full-grown elephant and rhinoceros.
Says Professor Ranke: “It is the mind of man that shows
itself superior to the most powerful brute force, even where
we meet him for the first time.” This remains true whether
the brute force be displayed in brutes or in other men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p_60" id="p_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>The great fact of intelligence, as against material
apparatus of any kind and even as against rigid instinct,
is its limitless applicability. With this one instrument
man achieves what without it could be achieved only by
a creature who combined in his own person every kind
of material apparatus, offensive and defensive, locomotor
or what not, which animal life, and vegetable life too,
have invented in the past&mdash;and not even by such a
creature. Man is a poor pedestrian, but his mind makes
locomotives which rival or surpass the fish of the sea,
the antelope on land, if not yet the bird of the air; his
teeth are of poor quality, but his mind supplies him with
artificial ones and enables him to cook and otherwise to
prepare his food. All the physical methods are self-limited,
but the method of mind has no limits; it is even
more than cumulative, and multiplies its capacities by
geometrical progression.</p>

<p><em class="psection">The cult of muscle.</em>&mdash;A word must really be said
here, in accordance with all the foregoing argument,
against the recent revival of what may be called the
Cult of Muscle. This cult of muscle, or belief in
physical culture, so called, as the true means of
race-culture, undoubtedly requires to have its absurd
pretensions censured. We now have many flourishing
schools of physical culture which desire to
persuade us to a belief in the monstrous anachronism
that, even in man, muscle and bone are still pre-eminent.
They want as many people as possible to believe that the
only thing really worth aiming at is what they understand
by physical culture. They pride themselves upon knowing
the names and positions of all the muscles in the
body, and on being able to provide us with instruments
to develop all these muscles: they are there and they
ought to be developed, and you are a mere parody of
what a man ought to be unless they are developed&mdash;none<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_61" id="p_61">[61]</a></span>
of them must be neglected. Many people have been
persuaded of these doctrines, and there is no doubt that
the physical culture schools do thus develop a large
number of muscles which have no present service for
man and would otherwise have been allowed to rest in a
decent obscurity.</p>

<p>In order to prove this point, let us instance a few
muscles which it is utterly absurd to regard as still possessing
any survival-value for man. In the sole of the
foot there are four distinct layers of muscles, by means
of which it is theoretically possible to turn each individual
toe to the left or the right, independently of its neighbours,
and to move the various parts of each toe upon
themselves, just as in the case of the fingers. All this
muscular apparatus is a mere survival, worth nothing at
all for the special purposes of the human foot. In point of
fact the human foot is now decadent, and probably not
more than two or three specimens of feet in a hundred
contain the complete normal equipment of muscles, bones
and joints&mdash;as Sir William Turner showed many
years ago. Thus many feet are possessed of muscles
designed to act upon joints which have not been developed
at all in the feet in question and which, if they
were there, would not be of the smallest use. To take
another instance, we do not now use our external ears
for the purpose of catching sound, though we still possess
muscles which, if thrown into action, would move the
external ear in various directions. Again, there is a flat,
thin stratum of muscle on the front of the neck, corresponding
to a muscle which in the dog and the horse is
quite important, but which is of no use to us. All would
be agreed as to the absurdity of devoting continued
conscious effort to the development of these particular
muscles; but in point of fact we have a whole host of
muscles which are in a similar case, and which are nevertheless<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_62" id="p_62">[62]</a></span>
objects of the most tender solicitude on the part
of the physical culturist. In general, this modern craze,
whilst highly profitable to those who foster it, is
most misguided and reactionary. Modern knowledge of
heredity teaches us that our descendants will not profit
muscularly in the slightest degree because of our devotion
to these relics: the blacksmith's baby has promise
of no bigger biceps than any one else's. Further, the
over-doing of muscular culture is responsible for the
consumption of a large amount of energy. A muscle is
a highly vital and active organ, requiring a large amount
of nourishment, which its possessor has to obtain, consume,
digest and distribute. The more time and energy spent
in sustaining useless muscles, the less is available for
immeasurably more important concerns. Man does not
live by brawn alone: he <i>does</i> live by brain alone.</p>

<p><em class="psection">Strength versus skill.</em>&mdash;So far as true race-culture
is concerned, we should regard our muscles merely
as servants or instruments of the will. Since we
have learnt to employ external forces for our purposes,
the mere bulk of a muscle is now a matter of
little importance. Of the utmost importance, on the
other hand, is the power to co-ordinate and graduate the
activity of our muscles, so that they may become highly
trained servants. This is a matter, however, not of
muscle at all but of nervous education. Its foundation
cannot be laid by mechanical things like dumb-bells and
exercises, but by games, in which will and purpose and
co-ordination are incessantly employed. In other words,
the only physical culture worth talking about is nervous
culture.</p>

<p>The principles here laid down are daily defied in very
large measure in our nurseries, our schools, and our
barrack yards. The play of a child, spontaneous and
purposeful, is supremely human and characteristic.<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_63" id="p_63">[63]</a></span>
Although, when considered from the outside, it is simply a
means of muscular development, properly considered it is
really <i>the</i> means of nervous development. Here we see
muscles used as human muscles should alone be used&mdash;as
instruments of mind. In schools the same principles
should be recognised. From the biological and psychological
point of view the playing-field is immeasurably
superior to the gymnasium. But it is in the barrack
yard that the pitiable confusion between the survival-value
of mind and muscle respectively in man is most
ludicrously and disastrously exemplified.</p>

<p>The glorious truth upon which we appear to act is that
man is an animated machine; that the business of the
soldier is not to think, not to be an individual, but to be
an assemblage of muscles. We see the marks of this idea
even in a fine poem: “Their's not to reason why, their's
but to do or die”&mdash;which, of course, might just as well
be said of a stud of horses or motor-cars. Further, our
worship of the machine is, consistently enough, an unintelligent
worship. We do not even recognise the best
conditions for its action. Every year hundreds of young
soldiers, originally healthy, have their hearts and lungs
and other vital organs permanently injured by the
imbecile attitude of chest&mdash;that of abnormal expansion&mdash;which
they are required to adopt during hard work.
Army doctors are now protesting against this, but it is
in accordance with the fitness of things that the cult of
muscle as against intelligence should be unintelligent.</p>

<p>I repeat that whilst in the study of race-culture the
physical cannot be ignored, since the psychical is so
largely dependent upon it, yet the physical is of worth
to us only in so far as it serves the psychical. The race
the culture of which we propose to undertake has long
ago determined to abandon the physical in itself as an
instrument of success. We are not attempting the<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_64" id="p_64">[64]</a></span>
culture of the cretaceous reptiles, which staked their all
upon muscle, and finally, having become as large as
houses&mdash;and as agile&mdash;suffered extinction. We are attempting
the culture of a species which, so far as the
physical is concerned, has long ago crossed the Rubicon
or burnt its boats. Even if Mr. Sandow and the drill-sergeant
had their way to the utmost, and, having finally
eliminated all traces of mind, succeeded in producing the
strongest and most perfect physical machine that could
be made from the human body, the species so produced
would go down in a generation before the elements or
before any living species that may be named. Man
has staked his all upon mind. The only physical
development that is really worth anything to such a race
is that which educates intelligence and morality, on the
one hand, and serves for their expression, on the other.</p>

<p>If there is any salient and irresistible tendency in our
civilisation to-day, it is the persistent decadence of
muscle and of all of which muscle is the type, as an
instrument of survival-value. The development of
machinery, much deplored by the short-sighted, is in the
direct line of progress, because it reduces the importance
of muscle and throws all its weight into the scale of mind.
Hewers of wood and drawers of water are becoming less
and less necessary, not because mechanical force is not
needed but because the human intelligence is learning
how to supersede the human machine as its source. Every
development of machinery makes the man who can merely
offer his muscles of less value to the community. Long
ago&mdash;not so very long ago in some cases&mdash;it was quite
sufficient for a man to be able to say “I am a good
machine:” he was worth his keep and had his chance of
becoming a parent; but the man whom society wants
now-a-days is not the man who is a good machine but
the man who can make one. These elementary truths<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_65" id="p_65">[65]</a></span>
are hidden, however, from the political quacks who discourse
to us upon unemployment.</p>

<p>Herbert Spencer's remark that it is necessary to be a
good animal has an element of truth in it which was
utterly ignored and needed proclamation at that time;
but it is necessary to be a good animal only in so far as
that state makes for being a good man&mdash;and not an iota
further.</p>

<p>The present interest in many most important aspects
of physical education, such as may be summed up under
the phrase “school hygiene,” must not blind us to the
great principle that physical education is a means and not
an end. Our present educational system, which permits
schooling to end just when it should begin, or rather
sooner, and which, even through our Government Departments,
permits boys to be used as little more than animated
machines, such as telegraph boys&mdash;is very largely
responsible for the great national evil of unemployment,
which we treat with soup-kitchens. We shall revise a
large proportion of our educational, political and social
methods just so soon as&mdash;but not before&mdash;we get into
our heads the idea that in human society, and pre-eminently
in society to-day, the survival-value of mind
and consequently the selection of mind must predominate
over the survival-value and consequent selection of
muscle. Further, whatever factors tend to enhance the
survival-value of the physical are <i>ipso facto</i> making for
retrogression and a return to the order of the beast.
Whatever tend to enhance the survival-value of the
psychical&mdash;by which I most assuredly include not only
intelligence but, for instance, motherhood&mdash;are <i>ipso
facto</i> forces of progress. The products of progress are not
machinery but men, and the well-drilled-machine idea of
a man ought to be as obsolete as more than one recent
war has proved it disastrous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p_66" id="p_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>There is here to be read no pessimistic suggestion that
the psychical is in any permanent danger. No one can
think so who knows its strength and the relative impotence
of the physical, but it is certainly possible that the
course of progress may be greatly delayed in any given
nation or race by worship of the physical, or even, as
Sparta shows, by worship of what may be called the
physical virtues as against the moral and intellectual
virtues. But those who are interested in the survival of
any particular race or nation have to remember that
arrest or retardation of progress therein, relatively to its
wiser neighbours, must, before long, result in its utter
downfall.</p>

<p><em class="psection">What are we to choose?</em>&mdash;The argument that the
selection of mind has been dominant throughout
human history is reinforced by such knowledge of
that history as we possess. There is no record of any
race that established itself in virtue of great stature
or exceptional muscular strength. Even in cases of
the most purely military dominance, it was not force
as such, but discipline and method, that determined
success; whilst some of the greatest soldiers in history
have been physically the smallest. The statement of the
anthropologists, already alluded to, regarding the selection
of the leading men in primitive tribes, may safely
be taken as always true: selection in human society has
always been, in the main, selection of that which, for
survival-value, is the dominant character of man, <i>mind</i>
in its widest sense. We shall see, later, that <i>physical
eugenics</i> can by no means be ignored: but our guiding
principle must be that the physical is of worth only in so
far as it serves the psychical, and is worse than worthless
in so far as it does not. It would surely be well, for
instance, that we should breed for “energy,” to use<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_67" id="p_67">[67]</a></span>
Mr. Galton's term: but the energy we desire, and the energy
he commends, is nervous, not muscular. The confusion
between two radically different things, vitality and muscularity,
is, however, almost universal, though it will not
stand a moment's examination. In a volume devoted to
personal hygiene I have discussed this point, which is of
real moment both for the individual and for the theory
of eugenics.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>It is of interest to note, in passing from this question,
that inherent facts of the human constitution would
interdict us if we thought it a fit ideal to breed for stature
or bulk. Giants are essentially morbid&mdash;not favourable
but unfavourable variations. They are very frequently
childless and almost constantly slow-witted. Their
condition is really a mild form of a well-marked and highly
characteristic disease known as acromegaly, and distinguished
by great enlargement of the face and
extremities. The malady depends upon peculiarities in
the glandular activities of the body: <i>and the state of these
which makes for great stature and bulk makes against intelligence</i>.
It is suggested, then, that any considerable
increase of human bulk and stature could only be
obtained at the cost of intelligence. It would be very
dear at the price.</p>

<p>When we come to the subject of selection for parenthood
in man through the preferences exhibited by individuals
for members of the opposite sex, we shall see that what
Darwin called “sexual selection” is certainly a reality
in the case of man, whether or not it be so in the case of<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_68" id="p_68">[68]</a></span>
the lower animals. We shall see that this most potent
factor in human evolution acts even now very favourably,
and is capable of having its value enormously enhanced.
In the selection of husbands, nervous or psychical factors
are notably of high survival-value in civilised communities.
In the selection of wives the survival-value of the
physical is still very high: but it may be hoped and
believed that the present tendency is to attach relatively
less importance to them and more to the psychical elements
of the chosen. This tendency must be furthered to
the utmost point beyond which the physical requisites
for motherhood would suffer weakening&mdash;but no further.</p>

<p><em class="psection">How are we to estimate civic worth?</em>&mdash;We have
already observed that it is incorrect to use the word
“fit” as if it were synonymous with “worthy.” If we
insist on using this term, which means only “adapted to
conditions,” we must define those conditions. We must
say that we desire to further the production of those who
are fit for citizenship, and to disfavour the production of
those who are unfit for citizenship. We shall thereby
dispose at least of those vexatious objectors who tell us
that many eminent criminals are individually superior to
many eminent judges. The statement is doubtless
untrue, but if it were true it would still be irrelevant.
A criminal may be individually a remarkable personality,
but in so far as he is a criminal he is unfit for citizenship.</p>

<p>It is far better to use consistently Mr. Galton's phrase,
“civic worth,” or, for short, “worth.” We may here note
Mr. Galton's most recent remarks on what he means by
worth:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p_69" id="p_69">[69]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot">

<p>“By this I mean the civic worthiness, or the Value to the State
of a person, as it would probably be assessed by experts or, say, by
such of his fellow-workers as have earned the respect of the community
in the midst of which they live. Thus the worth of
soldiers would be such as it would be rated by respected soldiers,
students by students, business men by business men, artists by
artists, and so on. The State is a vastly complex organism, and
the hope of obtaining a Proportional Representation of its best
parts should be an avowed object of issuing invitations to these
gatherings.</p>

<p>“Speaking only for myself, if I had to classify persons according
to Worth, I should consider each of them under the three heads of
Physique, Ability, and Character, subject to the provision that
inferiority in any one of the three should outweigh superiority in
the other two. I rank Physique first, because it is not only very
valuable in itself and allied to many other good qualities, but has
the additional merit of being easily rated. Ability I should place
second on similar grounds, and Character third, though in real
importance it stands first of all.”<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p></div>

<p>We shall certainly misunderstand this quotation unless
we clearly realise that Mr. Galton is speaking of eugenic
worth&mdash;that is to say, of worth in relation to parenthood
and heredity. No one, of course, would assert for a
moment that inferiority in the matter of physique outweighed
superiority in ability and character, so far as
our estimate of an individual as an individual is concerned,
nor yet so far as our estimate of him as a citizen
is concerned. But from the eugenic standpoint, as a
parent of citizens to come, such a person, though he may
have himself saved the State, is on the average rightly
to be regarded as unworthy on the eugenic scale&mdash;it being
assumed, of course, that the inferiority of physique in
the person in question is either native and therefore
transmissible, or else due to forms of disease, or poisoning,
such as, according to our knowledge of ante-natal
pathology, will probably involve degeneracy on
the part of his children. I would add that love is as
precious as ability, if not more so, and that we should
aim at its increase by making parenthood the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_70" id="p_70">[70]</a></span>
responsible act in life, so that children are born only
to those who love children and who will transmit their
high measure of the parental instinct and the tender
emotion which is its correlate.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<small>THE MULTIPLICATION OF MAN</small></h3>

<div class="chapterblockcentered">

“Increase and multiply”</div>


<p>The ceaseless multiplication of man is one of the facts
which distinguish him from all other living species, animal
or vegetable.<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>We must not be misled by such a case as that of the
multiplication of rabbits in Australia. Apart from such
circumstances as human interference, the earth is already
crammed with life of a kind, not the highest life nor the
most intense life, but at any rate fully extended life. Man
alone multiplies persistently, irresistibly, and has done
so from the very first, so that, arising locally, he is now
diffused over the whole surface of the earth. To quote
from Professor Lankester again: “Man is Nature's rebel.
Where Nature says Die! Man says I will live! According
to the law previously in universal operation man should
have been limited in geographical area, killed by extremes
of cold or of heat, subject to starvation if one kind of diet
were unobtainable, and should have been unable to increase
and multiply, just as are his animal relatives, without
losing his specific structure.... But man's wits and
his will have enabled him ... to ‘increase and multiply,’
as no other animal, without change of form.”</p>

<p>Not only has man made himself the only animal which
constantly increases in numbers, but this increase, as Professor
Lankester points out in another part of his lecture,<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_72" id="p_72">[72]</a></span>
already threatening certain difficulties, will be much more
rapid than at present, assuming the birth-rate to remain
where it is, when disease is controlled. It is within our
power, as Pasteur declared long ago, to abolish all parasitic,
infectious or epidemic disease. This must be and
will be done&mdash;within a century, I have little doubt. The
problem of the increase of human population will become
more pressing than ever. Professor Lankester suggests that
in one or five centuries the difficulty raised by our multiplication
“would, if let alone, force itself upon a desperate
humanity, brutalised by over-crowding and the struggle
for food. A return to Nature's terrible selection of the
fittest may, it is conceivable, be in this way in store for
us. But it is more probable that humanity will submit
to a restriction by the community in respect of the right
to multiply.” The lecturer added that we must therefore
perfect our knowledge of heredity in man, as to which
“there is absolutely no provision in any civilised community,
and no conception among the people or their
leaders, that it is a matter which concerns anyone but
farmers.”</p>

<p><em class="psection">The secret of multiplication.</em>&mdash;Professor Lankester,
however, omits to point out the astonishing paradox
involved in the fact that&mdash;as I pointed out at the
Royal Institution in 1907&mdash;man, the only ceaselessly
multiplying animal, has the lowest birth-rate of any
living creature.<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> From the purely arithmetical point
of view, what does it mean? We may defer at present
any deeper interpretation.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p_73" id="p_73">[73]</a></span></p>
<p>It means necessarily and obviously that the effective
means of multiplication is not a high birth-rate but a low
death-rate. It is a necessary inference from the paradox
in question that the infant death-rate and the general
death-rate in man are the lowest anywhere to be found.
Producing fewer young he alone multiplies.<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> It follows
that a smaller proportion of those young must die. Unless
it is supposed by bishops and others, then, that a peculiar
value attaches to the production of a baby shortly to be
buried, the suggestion evidently is the same as that to
which every humanitarian and social and patriotic impulse
guides us, namely, the reduction of the death-rate and
especially the infant mortality. This is the true way in
which to insure the more rapid multiplication of man, if
that be desired. I believe it is not to be desired, but in
any case the reduction of the death-rate and especially of
the infant mortality is a worthy and necessary end in
itself, and need not inevitably lead to our undue multiplication
provided that the birth-rate falls. Hence the
eugenists and the Episcopal Bench may join hands so far
as the reduction of the death-rate is concerned, and the
only persons with whom a practical quarrel remains are
those who&mdash;in effect&mdash;applaud the mother who boasts
that she has buried twelve.</p>

<p><em class="psection">The facts of human multiplication.</em>&mdash;Human population
continues to increase notwithstanding any
changes in the birth-rate. This fact remains true,
as shown by the latest obtainable figures. It should
be one of the dogmas never absent from the foreground
of the statesman's mind. Apparently nothing,
however, will induce us to take this little forethought.
When we build a bridge across the Thames, we ignore<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_74" id="p_74">[74]</a></span>
it; when we widen a bridge we ignore it likewise.
When we make a new street we ignore it; when we build
railways and railway stations we ignore it&mdash;excusably,
perhaps, in this case; when we build hospitals we ignore
it: four times out of five there is no room for the addition
of a single ward in time to come. We have not yet even
learnt, as they are learning in America and Germany,
how to acquire the outlying lands of cities for the public
possession, so that they may be properly employed as the
city grows. The man who builds himself a villa on the
outskirts of a city, ignores it, and is staggered by it in ten
years. The lover of nature and the country ignores it:
“Just look at this,” he says, “this was in the country
when first I knew it, look at these horrible rows of villas!”
The only possible reply to such a person is simply, “Well,
my dear sir, what do you propose? General infanticide?”
Most important of all, this fact, that, to take the case of
Great Britain, some half million babies are born every year
in excess over the number of all who die at all ages, is
forgotten by our statesmen&mdash;or rather by our politicians.
It could, of course, not be forgotten by a statesman.
Quite apart from remoter consequences, especially in
relation to the wheat supply, this persistent multiplication&mdash;which
one has actually heard denied on the ground that
the birth-rate is falling&mdash;is of urgent moment to all of us.</p>

<p>In 1907 the Census Bureau of Washington published
some figures on the mortality statistics of nations, a summary
of which may be quoted: <span class="pagenum"><a name="p_75" id="p_75">[75]</a></span>“In all parts of the
civilised world both the birth-rates and the death-rates
tend to decrease, and, as a rule, those countries having
the lowest death-rates have also the lowest birth-rates.
In Europe the lowest birth-rate is that of France, the
highest those of Servia and Roumania. The lowest death-rates
are in Sweden and Norway; the highest in Russia
and Spain. The downward tendency of the birth- and
death-rates is best shown by diagrams prepared by the
French Government, and it is probable that the downward
tendency is actually steeper than the diagrams show,
because both births and deaths are more accurately
registered than formerly.”</p>

<p>But these statements are by no means necessarily incompatible
with steady increase of population, which,
of course, increases so long as the birth-rate exceeds the
death-rate. I quote a few figures from the <i>Science Year
Book</i> of 1908:</p>

<p>In 1890 the total population of the world was estimated
at 1,487,900,000.</p>

<table summary="Population">
  <tr>
    <td class="tdl">Aryan (Europe, Persia, India, etc.)</td>

  <tr>
    <td class="tdl">American Indian</td>
    <td class="tdr padl">15,000,000</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>The total figure now must be something like sixteen
hundred millions at least.</p>

<p>Density of population, in so far as it means what is
commonly called over-crowding, is an important factor
in the death-rate, and has a most inimical influence upon
race-culture&mdash;in virtue of the opportunity afforded to
the racial poisons&mdash;syphilis, alcohol, etc. Thus Sweden
has the lowest death-rate in Europe, and has much
the least density of population&mdash;only 29 per square
mile as compared with our own 341. If now the fact
of the increase of population, with all that it means
and will mean, may be taken as dealt with and accepted,
there will be no danger of leading the reader to false
conclusions if we insist upon the fall of the birth-rate,
which in Great Britain in 1908 was the lowest on record.<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_76" id="p_76">[76]</a></span>
The death-rate, however, persistently falls also. The
reader who thinks that the birth-rate alone determines the
increase of population, and those who believe in polygamy
on the ground that it necessarily makes for the rapid
multiplication and therefore strength of a nation,
should compare the death-rate of London, which
is under 16, with that of Bombay, which is just under 79.
It is asserted that in many large Indian cities the infant
mortality approaches one-half of all the children born.
What it amounts to in such cities as Canton and Pekin we
can only surmise with horror.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the persistent fall in the birth-rate of
London the rate of increase in population remains
stupendous, according to the calculations of Mr. Cottrell,
which may be quoted from the <i>Science Year Book</i> of
1908. He estimates the population of Greater London
in 1910 at about 7½ millions, and in 1920 at well over
8½ millions&mdash;the falling birth-rate notwithstanding.</p>

<p>The increase of population of five great countries may
be briefly noted here. In all, with the possible exception
of Russia, the birth-rate is rapidly falling. In the course
of the nineteenth century the population of</p>

<p>These are merely approximate figures, but accurate
enough to be of value. It need hardly be pointed out
that immigration accounts for the disproportionate increase
of population in the United States. But it may
be added that the imminent arrest or control of this immigration
will assuredly have the most serious and pressing<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_77" id="p_77">[77]</a></span>
consequences for Europe. Plainly it must hasten the
coming of national eugenics.</p>

<p><em class="psection">The case of Germany.</em>&mdash;Especial interest and importance
attach for many reasons to the case of Germany in this
connection, and, as might be expected, many precise facts
are available. Here I shall avail myself freely of the
paper contributed by Dr. Sombart to the <i>International</i> for
December, 1907. In the first seven years of this century
the population of Germany increased almost ten per cent.
The figure in 1870 was 40.8 millions and in 1907 61
millions. The population is increasing yearly at the rate
of about 800,000, as compared with about half a million
in the case of Great Britain. In France in 1907 the
population actually declined by a few thousands. In
regard to the growth of population Germany is now at
the head of all civilised countries, excepting those cases
in which immigration has augmented the number of
inhabitants. Does this expansion of population depend
upon an increasing birth-rate or a diminishing death-rate?
The fact, in strict parallel with the biological generalisation
already made, is that “Germany's population is
increasing so swiftly because the death-rate has been falling
steadily. At the beginning of the period, 1870&ndash;1880,
there were nearly 30 deaths per thousand inhabitants,
while in recent years only about 20 deaths in every
thousand inhabitants have taken place each year....
Notwithstanding, the birth-rate during the last ten years,
during which the principal growth of population occurs,
has not in anywise increased in Germany. Indeed, by
careful investigation it becomes apparent that it has
declined almost unintermittently for a generation.” The
average birth-rate for the ten years 1871&ndash;1880 was 40.7,
for 1891&ndash;1900 the average was 37.4. Since then it has fallen
further, and in 1905 the figure was 34, the lowest on record.
As Dr. Sombart observes, we shall only appreciate these<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_78" id="p_78">[78]</a></span>
figures if we regard them as an expression of a tendency
which will continue, and that this is so he proves. He
observes that “the more highly advanced the country,
the lower its birth-rate.... From this we may already
draw the conclusion that a diminution of births is a concomitant
of our progress in civilisation. Secondly, this
is confirmed by the fact that the falling-off in the birth-rate
must be attributed largely to the big cities.... As a
third statistical argument that the birth-rate declines with
the advance of civilisation, the fact may be cited that in
the quarters of the well-to-do still fewer children are born
than in those of the poor.” (In London, as we have
seen, the birth-rate is highest in Stepney and lowest
in Hampstead).</p>

<p>Dr. Sombart finally points out what must never be
forgotten&mdash;that an increase in population, dependent upon
a fall in the death-rate, whilst the birth-rate also falls, is
necessarily self-limited. The decrease of the death-rate
is limited by definite natural age-limits, and “this indicates
that the increase of population in Germany is gradually
entering upon a period of less activity, and will perhaps
quite cease within a conceivable period unless other causes
operate in the opposite direction.”</p>

<p><em class="psection">The yellow peril.</em>&mdash;The facts regarding the yellow
races are extremely difficult to ascertain. It appears,
however, that the birth-rate in Japan has almost doubled
in 27 years&mdash;rising from 17.1 to 31. (I doubt the
accuracy of the earlier figure.) In China the population
is largely controlled by infanticide, but there is little
doubt that the main contention of Pearson was correct,
and that the yellow races are multiplying much more
rapidly than the white races. It does not necessarily
follow, however, as we shall see, that this means yellow
ascendancy, any more than a similar comparison would
mean microbic ascendancy. It is not quantity but<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_79" id="p_79">[79]</a></span>
quality of life that gives survival-value and dominance.
This disparity between white and yellow rates of increase
is by far the most pregnant of contemporary phenomena.
In the present introductory volume it can merely be
named. But since we shall not survive in virtue of
quantity, I, for one, am well assured that the choice for
Western civilisation will ere long be the final one between
eugenics or extinction.</p>

<p><em class="psection">The wheat problem.</em>&mdash;Meanwhile, we must consider
briefly the question evidently raised by this fact of
human multiplication. As an expert has lately said,
the rise in the price of wheat “is not the transitory
result of market manipulation and ‘corners,’ forcing
prices up to an unnatural level, but of perfectly natural
and irresistible causes which, for all that, are the more
anxious and disquieting. The truth is we are for the
first time beginning to feel individually the effect of a
great natural process&mdash;the race which started long ago
between the population of the world and the growth of
the world's wheat supply. In this race the growth of
the world's population has been outstripping the growth
of its wheat-food production, and the consequence has
been a total growing shortage, in spite of the opening of
vast new areas in Canada and the Argentina.” In this
connection one of the best papers in Great Britain&mdash;the
<i>Westminster Gazette</i>&mdash;cheerfully remarked in a leading
article that, after all, we need not be alarmed as to the
difficulty in increasing the supply of wheat, since population
would, in any case, adapt itself to the food-supply.
This is true, indeed: there will never be more human
beings than there is food to feed. But the question is,
how will the population be kept down? In a word,
is it to be by the awful and bloody processes of Nature
or by the conscious, provident and humane methods of
man?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p_80" id="p_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>We are reminded of the argument advanced by Sir
William Crookes in his Presidential Address to the British
Association in 1898. The distinguished author has
himself written an invaluable book on the subject which
has been carefully revised and supplemented, and must
be read by the serious student.<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> We may note from the
point of view of the student of dietetics that wheat is
and remains, on physiological examination, what the
proverb suggests. Bread is the staff of life, wheat being,
in proportion to its price, by far the best and cheapest
of all foods.</p>

<p>The argument of Sir William Crookes was advanced
exactly a century after the publication of the great essay
of Malthus which we must soon consider. In the whole
intervening century no one, capable of being heard, had
considered the question. The relation of Crookes to
the earlier thinker remains, though it is curious that
Malthus was not mentioned by his successor. Writing
now, a decade later, I wish merely to point out that
Sir William's argument is found valid. He observed
that “the actual and potential wheat-producing capacity
of the United States is&mdash;and will be, for years to come&mdash;the
dominant factor in the world's bread-supply.”
Now the recent expert from whom we have already
quoted declares that “former great wheat exporting
countries like the United States, as well as Russia and
India, while their production remains as high, are sending
far less abroad under the pressure of their own increasing
needs. In this connection it may be recorded that a
great American corn expert declares that in twenty-five
years the United States will want all, or very nearly all,
of her wheat production for herself, and will have very
little indeed to send us.” In 1898 Sir William said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_81" id="p_81">[81]</a></span>
“A permanently higher price for wheat is, I fear, a
calamity that ere long must be faced.” As everyone
knows, this prophecy is now being fulfilled. Sir William
declared that “the augmentation of the world's eating
population in a geometrical ratio” is a proved fact. The
phrase means, of course, simply that the yearly increase
increases. On the other hand, the wheat supply is subject
to a yearly increase which does not itself increase&mdash;in other
words the increase is in an arithmetical ratio. This, a
century later, precisely illustrates the principle of Malthus.
Sir William also declared that exports of wheat from the
United States are only of present interest, and that
“within a generation the ever-increasing population of
the United States will consume all the wheat grown
within its borders, and will be driven to import, and,
like ourselves, will scramble for the lion's share of the
wheat crop of the world.”</p>

<p>Next to the United States Russia is the greatest wheat
exporter, but the Russian peasant population increases
more rapidly than any other in Europe, even though it
is inadequately fed, and this source of supply must fail
ere very long. As Sir William points out, the Caucasian
civilisation is indeed founded upon bread. “Other races
vastly superior to us in numbers, but differing widely in
material and intellectual progress, are eaters of Indian
corn, rice, millet and other grains; but none of these
grains have the food-value, concentrated health-sustaining
power of wheat.” Sir William's argument was,
and is, that we must learn how to fix the nitrogen of
the atmosphere&mdash;that is to say, how to combine it in
forms on which the plant can feed. <span class="pagenum"><a name="p_82" id="p_82">[82]</a></span>“The fixation
of nitrogen is a question of the not far distant
future. Unless we can class it among certainties to
come, the great Caucasian race will cease to be foremost
in the world, and will be squeezed out of existence by
races to whom wheat and bread is not the staff of
life.”</p>

<p>Sir William Crookes was himself the pioneer in the
discovery of the electric method of fixing the atmospheric
nitrogen, and now, a decade after the delivery
of his address, this method is in successful commercial
employment in Scandinavia. There is also a method of
sowing the bacteria which are capable of fixing nitrogen
and this, according to some, has been already proved
practicable. Further, the Mendelians offer us the possibility
of new varieties of wheat having more grains to
the stalk than we obtain at present. By these methods
the output of the land devoted to wheat may be doubled
or trebled, but it is evident that even then there will be
an impassable limit. We have to face, indeed, the
evident but unconsidered fact that <i>there must be a maximum
possible human population for this finite earth</i>,
whether a bread-eating population or any other. I do
not propose to speculate regarding this evident truth.
If human life is worth living and is the highest life we
know, we may desire to obtain that maximum population,
but it must be obtained, and its limits observed, by the
humane and decent processes which man is capable of
putting into practice, and not by the check of starvation.</p>

<p>It is of great interest to the British reader to look at
the question briefly from his point of view. At the
present time our wheat production is no more than one-eighth
of our needs, and in twenty-five years, when the
supply from the United States will probably have ceased,
we shall require 40,000,000 quarters of wheat per annum.
Yet already, in time of peace, careful observers such as
the Rt. Hon. Charles Booth and Mr. Seebohm Rowntree
declare that thirty per cent. of our own population are
living on the verge of starvation. Our available supply of
food of all kinds at any moment would last us about three<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_83" id="p_83">[83]</a></span>
weeks. How many of us realise what a war would mean
for this country? Yet in the face of facts such as these,
the majority of those who attempt to guide public opinion
are urging us to increase our birth-rate and still pin their
faith to quantity rather than quality of population as
our great need.</p>

<p><em class="psection">The theory of Malthus.</em>&mdash;The reader who is interested
in general biology will realise, of course, that we are
here back to the great argument of Malthus, advanced in
1798 in his <i>Essay on the Principle of Population</i>.
Malthus was a great and sincere thinker, a high and true
moralist, and the people who have a vague notion that
his name has some connection with immoral principles
of any kind have no acquaintance with the subject.
It is of the deepest interest for the history of thought
to know that it was the work of Malthus which suggested,
independently, both to Charles Darwin and to Dr. Alfred
Russel Wallace, that principle of natural selection, the
survival of the fittest and their choice for parenthood,
the discovery of which constituted one of the great
epochs in the history of human knowledge, and which
is the cardinal principle underlying the whole modern
conception of eugenics or race-culture.</p>

<p>Malthus found in all life the constant tendency to
increase beyond the nourishment available. In a given
area, not even the utmost imaginable improvement in
developing the resources of the soil can or could keep
pace with the unchecked increase of population.<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> This
applies alike to Great Britain and to the whole world.
At bottom, then, the check to population&mdash;and this is
true of microbes or men&mdash;is want of food, notwithstanding
that this is never the immediate and obvious check
except in cases of actual famine. There must therefore
be a “struggle for existence,” and as Darwin and Wallace<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_84" id="p_84">[84]</a></span>
saw, it follows as a necessary truth that, to use Spencer's
term, the fittest must survive. The question is whether
we are to accept starvation as, at bottom, the factor
controlling population (which, in any case, must be
and is controlled) or whether we can substitute something
better&mdash;as for instance, the moral self-control which
Malthus recommended. The single precept of this
much maligned thinker was “Do not marry till you have
a fair prospect of supporting a family”&mdash;a fairly decent
and respectable doctrine. In the words of Mr. Kirkup,
“the greatest and highest moral result of his principle
is that it clearly and emphatically teaches the responsibility
of parentage, and it declares the sin of those who
bring human beings into the world for whose physical,
intellectual, and moral well-being no satisfactory provision
is made.” Who, alas, will declare that even after
a century and a decade this great lesson is yet learnt?</p>

<p>It is to be added, first, that though improvement in
agriculture is to be commended on every conceivable
ground, and though it may in some degree relieve and
postpone the difficulty, it is infinitely incapable of
abolishing it. Nothing but necessity can check the
prolificness of life. To this doctrine, however, there is,
as we shall shortly see, a great excepting principle, unrecognised
by Malthus, discovered by Herbert Spencer,
and of vast and universal importance. Secondly, it
is to be noted that emigration&mdash;a real remedy for over-population&mdash;is
so only for a time. It cannot possibly
abolish the problem&mdash;short of the development of interplanetary
communication, if then; and the observer of
contemporary politics must be well aware, as Germany,
for instance, is well aware already, that its effectiveness
as a practical remedy for over-population in some
European countries is already being arrested by the
invaded states.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p_85" id="p_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>The references already made to the work of Sir William
Crookes will suffice to show that the teaching of Malthus
is of practical importance to us to-day, and not least to
the population of Great Britain. I am tempted to quote
the actual case in this connection of a young student of
biology who applied for Malthus's book at one of the
greatest official libraries in this country. He was looked
at as a shameless young rascal, and the librarian curtly
said, “We have no books of that kind here.” I commend
this exquisite instance of misapplied and perfectly ignorant
British prudery to Mr. Bernard Shaw: not even he
could imagine anything to surpass it. No more impeccably
decent book than this of “Parson Malthus” has
ever been written, and I have no adequate comment for the
fact that its nature and contents were not merely wholly
unknown but grossly misimagined by this responsible
official, and that it could not be obtained in the great
library of science in question.</p>

<p>We pass in the following chapter to the momentous
discovery of Herbert Spencer that the great truth seen
by Malthus was not a whole but a half-truth, and that
there is a compensating principle, which is at once a
source of inspiration and of difficulty to the eugenist.
It is in general the principle that as life ascends it becomes
less prolific, and its consequences are infinitely more
vast than the phrase at first suggests. Had this principle
been discovered by a Continental thinker or by a member
of a British University instead of by a man who never
passed an examination, it would not now need the discussion
which we shall have to give it.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a><br />
<small>THE GROWTH OF INDIVIDUALITY</small></h3>


<p><em class="psection">The laws of multiplication.</em>&mdash;Implicit or explicit approval
of a falling birth-rate involves opposition to the opinion
of the man in the street, the general opinion of the medical
profession,<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> the bench of bishops and the social prophet
and publicist in general. Nevertheless a fall in the
birth-rate is a factor in organic progress, and, in general,
the level of any species is in inverse proportion to its
birth-rate, from bacteria to the most civilised classes of
men in the most civilised countries of to-day. But
in truth the uninformed opinion, totally contrary to the
whole history of life and to the most obvious comparative
facts of the birth-rate amongst and within present day
human societies, was utterly disposed of forty years ago
in the closing chapter of the greatest contribution yet
made to philosophic biology&mdash;Herbert Spencer's <i>Principles
of Biology</i>. The last chapter of that masterpiece
is entitled “The Laws of Multiplication.” Unfortunately
it has not been read by one in ten thousand of those
who think themselves entitled to hold, and even to express,
opinions about the birth-rate. Spencer's discovery is
the complementary half-truth to the discovery of Malthus,
and just as the law of Malthus is pessimistic, so the law
of Spencer is optimistic. In a word, Malthus assumed&mdash;indeed,
formally declared&mdash;that there was no natural
factor of an internal kind tending to limit the rate of<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_87" id="p_87">[87]</a></span>
vital fertility. Spencer discovered that there is such a
factor, which can and does limit and has been limiting
vegetable, animal, and human fertility since the dawn
of life.</p>

<p>All reproduction involves an expenditure of energy
in some degree on the part of the parent. Now the
energy available by any individual is finite. If he
expends it all upon reproduction, he himself, or she
herself, must cease to exist. This happens in all the
lowest forms of life, which multiply by fission or simple
splitting. The young bacteria are their sub-divided
parent. At the other extreme is the case of the individual
who retains the whole of his energy for his own development
and life, and has no offspring at all. Such consummate
bachelor philosophers as Kant and Spencer
may be quoted, and the list of childless men of genius
might be extended quite indefinitely. This is not to
declare this last state to be the ideal, but merely to point
out the logical extremes.</p>

<p>Spencer's principle is that there is an “Antagonism,” or,
as we may rather say, an inverse ratio, between “Individuation”
and “Genesis”&mdash;between the proportion of energy
expended upon the individual and the proportion expended
upon the continuance of the race. Thus “Individuation,”
meaning all those processes which maintain
and expand the life of the individual, and “Genesis,”
meaning all those processes which involve the formation
of new individuals&mdash;are necessarily antagonistic. Every
higher degree of individual evolution is followed by a
lower degree of race multiplication, and <i>vice versâ</i>. Increase
in bulk (<i>cf.</i> the elephant), complexity or activity
involves diminution in fertility, and <i>vice versâ</i>. This is
an obvious <i>à priori</i> principle.</p>

<p>Should the reader declare that there must be something
the matter with an asserted principle of progress which<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_88" id="p_88">[88]</a></span>
leads in theory or in practice to the production of a
childless generation, and therefore the end of all progress,
and that this principle suggests that the most completely
developed man and woman cannot be parents&mdash;then I
would join in the chorus of fathers and mothers generally,
who would say that, in human parenthood, if not, indeed,
in sub-human parenthood, the antagonism is reconciled
in a higher unity; that the best and most complete
development of the individual is effected only through
parenthood, in due degree&mdash;as Spencer, himself childless,
formally declared.</p>

<p>It is impossible here to show how complete is the
evidence for Spencer's law, both from the side of logical
necessity and from the side of observation. In order to
indicate the overwhelming character of the evidence, one
would have to transcribe the whole of his long chapter,
and to add to it all our modern knowledge of human
birth-rates. This cannot be done, but even without it
we may venture to say that people who regard a
falling birth-rate as in itself, and obviously, a sign
of racial degeneration or immorality, or approaching
weakness or failure of any kind, can have made no substantial
additions to their knowledge of the subject since
they themselves formed items in the birth-rate.</p>

<p>Spencer goes on to show, with profound insight, that, in
general, greater individuality, or, to put it in other words,
the more highly evolved organism, “<i>though less fertile
absolutely, is the more fertile relatively</i>.” The supreme
instance of this truth is, of course, the case of man, in
whom individuation has reached its unprecedented height,
who is <i>absolutely</i> the least fertile of creatures,<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> and yet
who is <i>relatively</i> the most fertile&mdash;unique in his actual
and persistent multiplication.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p_89" id="p_89">[89]</a></span></p>
<p><em class="psection">Their action in man.</em>&mdash;Within the human species the
laws of multiplication hold. It is still worth while, after
half a century, to quote Spencer's remark as to infertility
in women due to mental labour carried to excess&mdash;“most
of the flat-chested girls who survive their high-pressure
education are incompetent to bear a well-developed
infant and to supply it with the natural food for the
natural period.” On all hands people with opened eyes
are rightly urging this truth upon us to-day. In the
United States the so-called higher education of girls has
been proved in effect to sterilise them&mdash;and these the
flower of the nation's girlhood, and therefore, rightly,
the very elect for motherhood. Here is simply an
instance of the Spencerian principle in its most unfortunate
misdirection by man.</p>

<p>Before leaving Spencer, we must refer briefly to the
predictions, based upon the foregoing principles, with
which he concluded his great work. The further evolution
of man, he declares, must take mainly the direction of a
higher intellectual and emotional development. Hitherto,
and even to-day, pressure of population is the original
cause of human competition, application, discipline,
expenditure of energy&mdash;and one may add, the possibility
of continued selection. Excess of fertility, then, says
Spencer, is the cause of man's evolution, but “man's
further evolution itself necessitates a decline in his
fertility.” The future progress of civilisation will be
accompanied by increased development of individuality,
emotional and intellectual. As Spencer observes, this
does not necessarily mean a mentally laborious life, for
as mental activity “gradually becomes organic, it will
become spontaneous and pleasurable.”</p>

<p>Finally, the necessary antagonism between individuality
and parenthood ensures the ultimate attainment of the
highest form of the maintenance of the race&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_90" id="p_90">[90]</a></span>“... <i>a form
in which the amount of life shall be the greatest possible,
and the births and deaths the fewest possible</i>.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>If now we look back at the law of Malthus we shall
realise the enormous significance of the law of Spencer.
In this respect we have the advantage over Malthus that
we are aware, as he was not, of the great fact of organic
evolution. We discover, then, that an actual consequence
of the pressure of population, leading as it does to the
struggle for existence, and, in the main, the survival of
higher types, is that the rate of fertility falls. This conception
of the fall in the birth-rate&mdash;which, it is maintained,
has been a great factor in all organic progress&mdash;was
entirely absent from the mind of Malthus. In a
word, the unlimited multiplication which Malthus observed
leads to its own correction. It provides abundance
of material for natural selection to work upon, and then
the survival-value of individuation, wherever it appears,
asserts itself, with the consequence that the rate of
multiplication declines. This is actually to be observed
to-day. Malthus desired that we should postpone
marriage to later ages so as to lower the birth-rate. The
increasing necessity and demand for individuation is
effecting that which Malthus desired. The average age
at marriage has been rising in our own country in both
sexes during the last thirty years: and the evidence
shows that as civilisation advances the age of marriage
becomes later and later. Professor Metchnikoff has discussed
some aspects of this question in his book <i>The
Nature of Man</i>.</p>

<p><em class="psection">The intensive culture of life.</em>&mdash;For every student of
progress, and not least for the eugenist, Spencer's law is
a warrant of hope and a promise of better things to come.
It teaches that in the development of higher&mdash;that is to
say, more specialised&mdash;that is to say, more individualised&mdash;organic<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_91" id="p_91">[91]</a></span>
types, Nature is working already, and has been
working for ages, towards the elimination of the brutal
elements in the struggle for existence. This is, of course,
what every worker for progress, and every eugenist in
especial, desires. Spencer's discovery teaches also that
individuality compensates a species for loss of high
fertility. The survival-value of individuation is greater
than the survival-value of rapid multiplication. <i>The
very fact of progress is the replacement of lower by higher
life, the supersession of the quantitative by the qualitative
criterion of survival-value, the increasing dominance of
mind over matter, the substitution of the intensive for the
merely extensive cultivation of life.</i> These various phrases
express, I believe, various aspects of one and the same
great fact, and I only wish it were possible to include here
an exhaustive study of the conception which may be
expressed by the phrase “the intensity of life”&mdash;as
distinguished from its mere extension. There is, I believe,
a real and significant analogy between the introduction
of what is called intensive cultivation in agriculture, and
the eugenic principle which seeks to replace the extensive
by the intensive cultivation of human life.</p>

<p><em class="psection">The eugenic difficulty.</em>&mdash;But it will be already evident
to the reader that, though Spencer's law offers hope and
warrant to the eugenist, it also poses him with a permanent
and ineradicable difficulty which is inherent in natural
necessity&mdash;viz., the difficulty that, in consequence of the
operation of this law, those very classes or members of a
society whose parenthood he most desires must be, in
general, the least fertile. Throughout the animal world
the lesser fertility of higher species is no real handicap
to them, as we know; but where the conditions of selection
are so profoundly modified as in human society, the case
is very different. Furthermore, amongst mankind individuality
has often grown, and does grow, to such an<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_92" id="p_92">[92]</a></span>
extent that parenthood disappears altogether. Indeed,
Spencer's law expresses itself&mdash;and the eugenist must
qualify his hopes by the fact&mdash;in the practical infertility
of many<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> of the most highly individualised and even
unique personalities, that is to say, in the ranks of what
we call genius. To this subject we must return.</p>

<p>A notable section in Mr. Galton's great work, <i>Inquiries
into Human Faculty</i>, states very plainly the difficulty
for the eugenist involved in Spencer's law, under its more
statistical aspect. What are the relative effects of early
and late marriages? Mr. Galton proves, mathematically,
that in a very few generations a group of persons who
marry late will be simply bred down and more than
supplanted by those who marry early. Now no one will
dispute that the less individualised, the lower types, the
more nearly animal, do in general marry earlier, and are
more fertile. Here, then, is an anti-eugenic tendency
in human society, depending really upon Spencer's law
and requiring us to recognise and counteract it by
throwing all the weight we can upon the side of
progress, which means <i>increasing to our utmost the
survival-value and the effective fertility of the higher
types</i>.</p>

<p>Much more space might be spent upon this gravest of
problems for the eugenist&mdash;the fact that the very persons
from whom he desires to recruit the future on account of
their greater individuality are also on that very account
the persons who, by natural necessity, tend to be less
fertile. The difficulty shows itself in the male sex, but
it shows itself still more conspicuously in the female sex,
where the proportion of the individual energy devoted to
the race, as compared with that devoted to individuation,
is necessarily far higher, and must so remain if the race
is to persist. Primarily, the body of woman is the temple<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_93" id="p_93">[93]</a></span>
of life to come&mdash;and <i>therefore</i>, as we shall some day teach
our girls, the holy of holies. Without going further into
this matter now, it may be suggested that a cardinal
principle of practical importance is involved. It is that
the individual development of women, their higher
education, their self-expression in works of art and
thought and practice, cannot safely be carried to the
point at which motherhood is compromised; else the
race in question will necessarily disappear and be
replaced by any race whatsoever, the women of which
continue to be mothers. There are women of the worker
bee type whom this argument annoys intensely. No
one wants <i>them</i> to be mothers.</p>

<p>The proposition that all progress in the psychical world
depends upon individuality, just as all organic progress,
and indeed, all organic evolution, depends upon the
physical individuality which biologists call variation,
may suggest to the reader the importance which must
attach to our study of talent and genius, and the possibility
of aiding their production. Meanwhile, we must
look a little further at the general question of individuality
or quality <i>versus</i> quantity from the international point
of view.</p>

<p><em class="psection">Quantity versus quality.</em>&mdash;The reader will understand
how it is that anyone writing from the biological standpoint
must view with something like contempt the
common assumption that, in international competition,
mere statistics of population furnish, as such, final and
adequate data for prophecy. Let us remind ourselves
once more that, according to these crude criteria, which
were really superseded untold æons ago, the dominance
of the world must belong in the near future not to Russia,
with its balance of more than two million births per
annum, rather than to France, with its approximately
stationary population, but to the bacteria, the growth<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_94" id="p_94">[94]</a></span>
of population amongst which, if it be not controlled by
the less fertile creature we call man, may be of simply
inexpressible magnitude. But the world is not, and will
not be, ruled by bacteria, their fertility notwithstanding.
Indeed, the disease-producing bacteria have
already had sentence of death pronounced upon
them by the higher intelligence of man, and that
sentence will be carried out within a century. Similarly
within the bounds of humanity we must recognise the
limitations of mere statistics. The population of France,
some forty years ago, consisted of so many millions of
units. The figure does not matter,&mdash;let us put it at
30,000,001. Now that 1, so to say, was called Louis
Pasteur, and from the point of view of statistics or those
who think they can predict history by counting heads,
he was only an almost infinitesimal fraction, about one-thirty-millionth
part, of the French people. Yet, as
Huxley pointed out long ago, his mind sufficed to pay the
entire indemnity exacted from France after the Franco-Prussian
war. This single unit was worth more than a
host of soldiers of the merely mechanical kind. Or take
Athens, with its population of 30,000 people, mostly
slaves, and consider its influence upon the world. Or,
indeed, go where you please, whether to the history of
nations or the history of religion or science or art, and ask
whether the counting of heads, the ordinary census taking
which indeed amounts merely to weighing nations by the
ton, is an adequate one. In estimating national capital
by the methods of vital statistics alone, we are in a far
worse case than he would be who estimated monetary
wealth by numbers of coins, without considering whether
they were pounds, shillings or pence, whether they were
genuine or counterfeit. The illustration is ludicrously
inadequate, as every illustration must be, simply because
the human case is unique. In the units of a population,<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_95" id="p_95">[95]</a></span>
which many prophets treat as if they were all of equal
value, there are not merely differences to which the
difference between a sovereign and a penny offers no
parallel; there is not merely an enormous quantity of
bogus or counterfeit units, but there is a very large
number of units in every population which, so far from
adding to the value of the rest, subtract from it, are
parasitic upon it. Students of money will find no parallel
to this. Yet in the face of facts which ought to be
common intellectual property amongst school-children,
we find many writers, bishops, socialist economists,
moralists, schoolboy Imperialists, and the rest, pointing
merely to the quantitative question of population as if
it were everything, though they must surely know that,
if international competition were the highest state of
mankind, and if the work of Kelvin and Lister had been
sold at its real worth by us to the rest of the world, those
two men alone, in their services to life, and in the power
which they give us over life, would be equal in value to,
shall we say, the lower four-fifths of the whole birth-rate
during the last generation. All human history teaches,
as all animal history teaches in lesser degree, that quality
and individuality is everything, that quantity is nothing
or far worse than nothing <i>except in so far as it is quantity
of quality</i>: yet though this lesson is written upon every
page of the past, the greater number of our publicists
and our public advisers still implicitly deny it. As Mr.
Crackanthorpe put it, speaking of the figures for 1907,
it is not the defective numbers, but the numbers of defectives,
that should give us concern.</p>

<p><em class="psection">Mass versus mind.</em>&mdash;John Ruskin called Darwin “a dim
comet, wagging its tail of phosphorescent nothing
against the steadfast stars”&mdash;a description as delightful
as it is foolish. Yet the conception of eugenics, which
is indeed a necessary deduction from Darwin's great<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_96" id="p_96">[96]</a></span>
discovery, finds abundant warrant and support in Ruskin's
own wonderful writings, and here I quote, from <i>Time and
Tide</i>, some sentences which still require to be read and
remembered by the majority of our present advisers.
He says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“And the question of numbers is wholly immaterial, compared
with that of character; or rather, its own materialness depends
on the prior determination of character. Make your nation consist
of knaves, and, as Emerson said long ago, it is but the case of
any other vermin&mdash;the more, the worse. Or, to put the matter in
narrower limits, it is a matter of no final concern to any parent
whether he shall have two children, or four; but matter of quite
final concern whether those he has shall, or shall not, deserve to
be hanged.... You have to consider first, by what methods of
land distribution you can maintain the greatest number of healthy
persons; and secondly whether, if, by any other mode of distribution
and relative ethical laws, you can raise their character, while
you diminish their numbers, such sacrifices should be made, and
to what extent?... The French and British public may and
will, with many other publics, be at last brought ... to see
farther that a nation's real strength and happiness do not depend
upon properties and territories, nor on machinery for their defence,
but on their getting such territory as they <i>have</i>, well filled with
none but respectable persons, which is a way of <i>infinitely</i> enlarging
one's territory, feasible to every potentate.”</p></div>

<p>Surely it is not necessary, one feels, and yet one knows
it is necessary, again to lay down propositions of such
shining truth, and one wonders whether they shine so
brightly as to blind those who should see them: or what
can conceivably be the explanation of such arguments
as those of the Bishop of London and others who, in the
face of our monstrous infant and child mortality, the
awful pressure of population and over-crowding in our
great cities, where every year a larger and larger proportion
of the population lives, and is born and dies&mdash;plead
for a higher birth-rate on moral grounds, of all
amazing grounds conceivable; and those also who, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_97" id="p_97">[97]</a></span>
the military or so-called Imperial point of view, regarding
men primarily as “food for powder,” in Shakespeare's
phrase, read and quote statistics of population in order
to promulgate the same advice?</p>

<p>To the moralist we need make no reply except simply
to name the infant mortality which is at last coming to
be recognised everywhere as, perhaps, the most abominable
of all our scandals. To the militarist I would
quote the case of our ally, Japan. He recalls the war
between China and Japan, and its issue, and has some
idea, perhaps, of the population ratio of those two Empires.
How was it that Providence was on the side of the small
battalions? He recalls also the Russo-Japanese war
and its issue; and the population ratio of the two
Empires in that case. How many other instances does
not military history afford of the truth that in the human
species mind is the master of matter? One would suppose
that a critical historical enquiry had been made, proving
that the results of all past wars could have been predicted
by the simple method of estimating the total aggregate
weight of the combatant nations in flesh and blood and
bone! More than this, if the development of the art
of warfare means anything, if there has been any such
development since the days of fists and stones, it means,
as all human development in every sphere means, the
increasing dominance of mind over matter, character and
initiative over machinery, <i>dead or alive</i>. Meanwhile, the
estimate of warriors in terms of the scale and the
foot rule are still accepted just as if they had not been
rendered obsolete for ever with the passing of the
“dragons of the prime.”</p>

<p>As regards the psychical worth of the soldier, is it not
recognised, though too commonly forgotten, when we
applaud the value of the veteran or of seasoned troops?
Physically the veteran is, on the average, inferior to<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_98" id="p_98">[98]</a></span>
the younger man. It is the psychical that gives him
his worth, just as it was patriotism and sobriety that
enabled the few sober Japanese to beat the many drunken
Russians. It is safe to prophesy that, in all future war,
the numerical criterion, which in effect weighs armies
by the ton, as if war were merely a tug-of-war, will
become less and less important&mdash;if, indeed, it is not
already negligible; whilst the purely psychical qualities,
from generalship and strategy and hygiene to initiative,
judgment, accuracy, memory, and down finally to mere
brutal red-blooded courage, will determine the issue.</p>

<p>Platitude, of course, but if true, why ignored? Why
cannot our military advisers learn, in this respect, from the
Navy? Owing to the very nature of the sea as compared
with the land, in relation to the merely physical capacities
of man, a Navy must be more intelligent than an Army,
just as it requires more intelligence to make a boat than
to walk; and it is in the Navy that the mechanical
factor has been most completely transferred, so that
the human machinery is at a discount and the steel
machinery made by the human mind is much, whilst
the value of the psychical in all its aspects dominates
and controls the whole. Great Britain, as the foremost
naval power in the world, should long ago have left to
its ultimate fate amongst other nations the idea that
quantity&mdash;so many tons of soldiers and so many tons
of sailors&mdash;affords an estimate of the warring force of
a nation: even if the whole history of this little isle and
the possession of our present Empire did not teach, as
the history of Rome taught and as the history of Athens
teaches in another sphere, that not mass but mind makes
a nation great.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a><br />
<small>HEREDITY AND RACE-CULTURE</small></h3>

<div class="chapterblock">

<p>“We cannot but feel that the application of biological results
is <i>only beginning</i>, and beginning with a tardiness which is a
reproach to human foresight. There can be no doubt that it
would pay the British nation to put aside a million a year for
research on eugenics, or the improvement of the human breed.”
(Prof. J. A. Thomson, <i>Heredity</i>, 1908.)</p></div>


<p>It is evident that the facts and principles of heredity
lie at the very basis of eugenics or race-culture in any of
its forms, practical or impractical, scientific or unscientific.
Our continual assumption throughout is that <i>like tends
to beget like</i>, and it is on this ground that we desire to
make parenthood the privilege of those whom we regard
as <i>inherently</i> the best. If there were no such thing as
heredity there could be no possibility of race-culture&mdash;nor
indeed should we be here to discuss it. If a man's
children were equally likely to be acorns or babies or
tadpoles, the living world would not be the living world
we know.</p>

<p>The potency of heredity is obscured to uncritical
examination by the fact that that which is inheritable
is that which was innate, inherent or germinal in the
parent, as we shall shortly see. We, however, are apt
to compare the child with the parent, who has perhaps
been much modified by circumstances, so that the
resemblance between father and child may seem to
be slight. Yet if we could bring back before us that
father, as he was, say at the age of two, and compare
him with his two-year-old child, we should perhaps be<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_100" id="p_100">[100]</a></span>
astonished by the resemblance. But we see the acquirements
or acquired characters of the parent; make no
distinction between them and his inherent characters;
fail to discover these acquired characters in his child;&mdash;and
discount the importance of heredity. Then, again,
the eugenist may be utterly confounded if he estimates
the parental value of an individual without reference
to this limitation of heredity. Here is a man of culture
and accomplishment; his children, then, will presumably
tend to be cultured and accomplished. But every kind
of advantage that forethought and love and money
can afford may have been showered upon that man.
So far as native endowment was concerned, he may
have indeed been far below mediocrity. Now it is
native endowment alone that he can transmit, and our
eugenic estimate of him is therefore erroneous and will
lead to disappointment. It is impossible to lay too
great stress upon the truth that in all eugenic plans or
demands or practices we are assuming the fact of inheritance,
and that therefore it is our first business to
distinguish absolutely between that which tends to
be inherited and that which, on the other hand, is never
inherited.</p>

<p>Yet again, this distinction is of almost incalculable social
moment in so far as it affects the process of selection
actually occurring in society. This, perhaps, has not
been adequately recognised. One may repeat a former
statement of this point, which is cardinal for the
eugenist:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p_101" id="p_101">[101]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot">

<p>“Even supposing that we were all identical at birth, yet, since
we would come to differ from one another in virtue of different
acquirements, due to our adaptation to differing environments,
natural selection would ultimately have different individuals from
which to select. Those who had made the most advantageous
acquirements, such as industry or great knowledge, would tend to
survive and prosper, whilst those who had made disadvantageous
acquirements, such as laziness or the loss of sight or limbs, would
be pushed to the wall. That process, of course, occurs in society
at the present day to a greater or less degree, but it has only
immediate and temporary or contemporary consequences. For if
we recall the assertion that acquirements cannot be transmitted,
we shall see that the selection of those who have made
advantageous acquirements cannot benefit the next generation,
since these acquirements die with their makers. The only process
of natural selection which can result in progress is one which
consists in the selection of favourable ... inborn and therefore
transmissible characters, such as good digestion, the musical sense,
exceptional intelligence, the sympathetic temperament or what
not (in so far as these are inborn)&mdash;the reason being that such are
transmissible and that the children of persons so selected will tend
to inherit their parents' good fortune. There is a fictitious way in
which we speak of a child inheriting his father's acquirements, as
when his father has acquired a fortune; but the child does much
better to inherit his father's good sense or good health, which
were characters inborn in him. Acquirements, then, are all very
well for the day, but it is inborn characters that alone count for
the morrow.”<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p></div>

<p>It may be added that the time is coming when there
will be a radical “transvaluation,” as Nietzsche would say,
of the two fashions in which a father “leaves” something
to his children. When a question is asked on
this head now-a-days, we mean, foolishly enough, to
enquire how much money the father left his child, and
we say of a man that he has “inherited” a fortune.
We can see plainly enough, as Theognis did two thousand
five hundred years ago, that such an “inheritance”
may and often does work in an anti-eugenic fashion.
The gilded fool is swallowed by the maiden whose native
sense would have rejected such a pill without its coat,
and so the most pitiable degenerate becomes the father
of his like. This point will be alluded to later. The
present argument is that when we ask what a father<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_102" id="p_102">[102]</a></span>
“left” his children, we should really desire to learn
what he <i>gave</i> them when he was still alive and begot them.
These vital, or mortal, characters which they inherit&mdash;shall
we say good health or insanity&mdash;are of incalculably
more moment to them as individuals than any monetary
fortune, and of incalculably more moment for the future.
Yet again is it true that there is no wealth but life, and
the best “fortune” or wealth that you can leave your
children is sane and vigorous life.</p>

<p><em class="psection">The case of slum childhood.</em>&mdash;We have already seen
that even in the slums the children make a fresh start
in a wonderful way, that their stunted growth, their
proneness to disease, are mainly due to their environment,
which it is therefore our duty to improve. This is <i>in
general</i> true, and depends evidently upon the fact that the
acquired deterioration of the parents&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, dental decay&mdash;is
not transmitted to their children&mdash;poisonings apart&mdash;so
that the children make a fresh start where their parents
did. It is necessary to point this out again and again, as
the present writer for one has long been weary of doing,
because it indicates our immediate duty in this respect,
and forbids us to shirk it with any too-comprehensive
phrases about “national degeneration.” Now who could
have predicted that this plain and simple truth would be
regarded by some people as constituting a denial&mdash;on
strict scientific grounds, and as the very latest scientific
pronouncement&mdash;of the principle of heredity? “The
bubble of heredity has been pricked,” says Mr. Bernard
Shaw.</p>

<p>But popular muddleheadedness does not affect the
palpable and universal truth that the <i>inherent</i> characters
of parents do tend to be inherited by their children; nor
yet that these inherent characters differ profoundly in
different individuals; nor yet the eugenic argument,
which is that for purposes of parenthood, which means<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_103" id="p_103">[103]</a></span>
for the entire future, some of these should be taken and
others left.</p>

<p>“Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather
grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?... Wherefore
by their fruits ye shall know them.” These classical
words surely have a special value for the eugenist. As
we have said, it is his particular necessity, alike in theory
and in practice, to “know” the real nature, the innate,
inherent, germinal characters, of the individuals who
may or may not be parents: and these, as we have seen,
are frequently obscured by the action of the environment&mdash;as,
for instance, in the population of the slums on the
one hand, or the man of factitious culture on the other
hand. But “by their fruits ye shall know them.” In
general, the children inherit what was innate in their
parents, and in many an instance the surest way in which
you could ascertain what the parent really was by nature&mdash;what,
as we say, Nature “meant” him to be&mdash;is
by a study of his children. Only, of course, we must
take the children very young indeed, before environment
has made its mark upon them also, for better or for
worse. Thus, when we find the new-born baby of
some pallid, half-starved, stunted mother in the
slums, to be healthy and vigorous and beautiful,<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> by this
fruit we shall know what the mother might and should
have been. A healthy baby goes far to demonstrate
that the stock is healthy. This is one of the cardinal
truths which emerge from the study of infant mortality,
and it may be perhaps permitted to warn some students
of race-culture of the errors into which they are bound
to fall if they do not reckon with what the student of
infant mortality is constantly asserting: viz., that the
babies of the slums, seen early, before ignorance and<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_104" id="p_104">[104]</a></span>
neglect have had their way with them, are physically
vigorous and promising in certainly not less than ninety
per cent. of cases. This primarily demonstrates, of
course, the murderous nature of our infant mortality;
but it also demonstrates to the eugenist that these classes
are perhaps not so unworthy as he may fancy. By their
new-born babies ye shall know them. It is under the
influence of such considerations that the present writer,
for one, is somewhat chary of predictions and proposals
based upon the relative fertility of different classes of
the community or of the masses as compared with the
classes. Directly the eugenist begins to talk in terms of
<i>social</i> classes (as Mr. Galton has never done), he is
skating on thin ice, and if it lets him through, he will
find the remains of many of his rash predecessors beneath
it.<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>In fine, then, if we observe the distinction between
the innate and the acquired, which is the distinction
between the transmissible and the intransmissible, this
is so far from denying the fact of heredity at all as
in reality to emphasise its potency whilst undoubtedly
diminishing its range.</p>

<p><em class="psection">A criticism of terms.</em>&mdash;In order that this distinction
may be clear and never forgotten, it is well to look to
our vocabulary&mdash;words being good servants but bad
masters. We should certainly have this vocabulary
purged altogether of a certain word in common and
uncritical employment, especially by the medical profession.
This is the thoroughly misleading, indeterminate<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_105" id="p_105">[105]</a></span>
and useless word “congenital.” Not on one occasion in
a hundred of its use does any examined meaning attach
to it. The word is commonly used as the equivalent of
innate, inherent, inborn or germinal. Now nothing is
truly innate or inborn save what was present in the germ.
But with childish confusion of thought, we persist in
attaching quite undeserved importance to the <i>birth</i> of
those animals which are brought forth “alive”&mdash;as if a
bird's egg were not alive. Hence we speak of any character
present at birth as congenital, and then we assume that
congenital is synonymous with inherent or germinal.
But it is an irrelevant detail that a young mammal
happens to leave its mother at the ninth week or month.
During the whole period that it spends within its mother,
it is to be regarded as an individual organism with its
own environment. If that environment so affects it as
to strangle a limb, the result is an acquirement, though
it may be present at birth. An acquirement is an
acquirement, whether it be acquired five minutes or
months before, or five minutes or months after, the
change of environment which we call birth. Thus a
character may be congenital&mdash;that is, present at birth&mdash;but
not inherent or germinal, not inborn at the <i>real
birth</i>, which was the union of the maternal and paternal
germ-cells at conception. Such congenital characters are
really acquirements, and&mdash;poisonings apart&mdash;are not
transmissible. In common discussion this distinction is
wholly ignored; and two distinct things, fundamentally
different in origin and in potency, are lumped together
under the blessed word “congenital.”</p>

<p>This word is equally foolish and useless in an opposite
direction. It constantly leads those who use it to suppose
that the inherent characters of an individual are
conterminous with his congenital characters or his characters
at birth, and that thus any characters which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_106" id="p_106">[106]</a></span>
displays at a later age are acquired. All this comes of
the absurdly delusive significance attached to the change
of environment called birth, and may doubtless be traced
historically to the remotest superstitions which imagined
that a baby is not alive until it is born and breathes, or
that the soul or breath or <i>pneuma</i> or “vital principle”
is breathed into it at the moment of birth. We know,
however, that a man may display for the first time at
the age of twenty or sixty a character which was as truly
inherent in his constitution as his nose or his spinal
column&mdash;perhaps a beard, perhaps a mental character,
perhaps a disease, or what not. Now this was not congenital
though it was inherent. But as long as the
stupid<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> word “congenital” is used as it is, we shall fail
to realise that inherent characters may display themselves
in an individual at any time after birth as at any time
before birth. Thus, to sum up, a character may be
congenital or rather <i>pre-congenital</i>, yet not inherent but
acquired: a character may be post-congenital, yet not
acquired but inherent. Now the all-important question
as regards heredity is not at what date in the history of
an individual a character appears&mdash;as, for instance, before
birth or after birth; but, whether that character is
inherent and therefore transmissible and therefore a
possible architect of the future of mankind; or merely
an acquirement, with which&mdash;the racial poisons apart&mdash;heredity
has no concern.</p>

<p>It is suggested, then, that the word congenital be
expunged from the vocabulary of science, or that, if it be
retained, some meaning or other&mdash;any will do&mdash;be
attached to it. If the word is to be retained, and if it
be agreed to attach a meaning to it, probably “at birth”
would be the most convenient. If this were agreed upon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_107" id="p_107">[107]</a></span>
then the phrase “congenital blindness,” now in common
use, could be retained, as it would then accurately indicate
the nature of the blindness in question, which is due
almost invariably, if not invariably, to an infection
acquired at the moment of birth.</p>

<p>Yet further. When we say that a man's intelligence
or length of limb or whatever it be is hereditary, we mean
in ordinary speech that this character can be traced in
one or more of his ancestors; and that is, of course, an
accurate use of the term. But Shakespeare, for instance,
had unremarkable ancestors, so that no one would say
that his genius was hereditary; are we, then, to say
that it was acquired? Every one would protest at once
that a poet is born and not made&mdash;than which there is
certainly no truer popular saying. What, then, is to be
said of it if it was neither hereditary nor acquired? The
truth is that language is again at fault. Shakespeare's
genius was of inherent or germinal origin&mdash;the poet is
born and not made: or, more accurately, the poet is
conceived and not made, either before birth or after it.
Therefore, though Shakespeare did not inherit his
mother's genius or his father's genius, neither of them
having such a gift to transmit, yet his genius was certainly
potential either in the maternal or paternal germ-cell
which united to form him, or in both; or at the least arose
in consequence of that compromise or rearrangement or
settlement, shall we say, which is in effect always agreed
upon by the two germ-cells in bi-parental reproduction.
Now the two germ-cells are the hereditary material.
They were given to Shakespeare by his parents; nay
more, they made him. His genius, then, was hereditary
in an absolutely correct sense of the word, yet not in the
sense of ordinary speech, nor even in the sense in which
it is employed by Mr. Galton in his book on <i>Hereditary
Genius</i>. This confusion of terms is responsible for much<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_108" id="p_108">[108]</a></span>
confusion of thought. It must the more urgently be
cleared up because of the discoveries in heredity initiated
by the Abbot Mendel, forty years ago, and now included
in the department of the science of heredity which is
called Mendelism. We learn from this that highly
definite characters may appear in offspring though there
was no sign of them in either parent. These, then, are not
hereditary in the sense of ordinary speech. Yet, in a
more accurate sense of the word they can be proved to
be hereditary&mdash;nay more, the manner and proportion of
their transmission can be predicted in the most exact
mathematical terms. These characters were not present
in the parent's body; they did not lie open to view in
the parent; they were not patent in the parent. They
were latent, however, they lay hid, in the parent, or
rather in the germ-plasm of which that parent was the
host. In many such cases, if we go back a generation
further we find that the character in question was patent
in a grand-parent. A mother's son may suffer from
hæmophilia or the bleeding disease, yet she is not a
“bleeder,” nor is the boy's father; but her father was a
bleeder, and the disease is, of course, hereditary in her
son, though neither of his parents displayed a trace of it.</p>

<p>Thus an individual may inherit or may have inherent
in the germ-cells from which he was formed characters
which were not present in either parent. They were,
however, potentially present in the germ-cells of which
those parents were the trustees.</p>

<p>But, the reader will say, do we find in the case of every
“sport” or “transilient variation,” such as Shakespeare,
that the new character was, after all, present in some one
or other of his ancestors though absent in his immediate
parents? The answer is negative, certainly. But genius,
to take this case, is a combination of qualities. And the
Mendelians are now able to call into existence organisms<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_109" id="p_109">[109]</a></span>
of new kinds by combination of qualities derived from
one parent, or rather from one parental line, with other
qualities, formerly apparently incompatible with them
derived from the other parental line. Thus Professor
Biffen of Cambridge has called into existence a new kind of
wheat such as never existed before&mdash;a wheat combining
the quality technically called “strength,” hitherto lacking
in all kinds of wheat capable of being profitably grown in
Great Britain, with the power of yielding a large crop
and other good qualities found in home-grown wheat.
He has also produced a wheat which, together with other
desirable qualities, is immune from the disease known as
“rust,” this immunity having never been found before
associated with the other good qualities in question.
These advances will not long be limited to the vegetable
world merely. Perhaps it requires no very great imagination,
after all, to suppose that even something like that
combination of qualities which we call genius may some
day be produced at will in mankind.</p>

<p>Such a new wheat, then,&mdash;I will not say such a Shakespeare&mdash;owes
its unique and unprecedented properties to
heredity, and yet there was never anything like it before.
Its “genius” is not “hereditary.”</p>

<p>The words <i>innate</i> and <i>inborn</i> are harmless and may be
employed, though the apparent emphasis on birth is rather
unfortunate. We mean, however, by innate or inborn
qualities, qualities which were potential in the germ. The
genius of Shakespeare was innate or inborn. It was
present potentially at his real birth, the union of the
parental cells. It preceded his “birth” in the ordinary
sense of the word: Shakespeare, when only <i>in embryo</i>,
was a Shakespeare <i>in embryo</i>.</p>

<p>Better still is the word <i>inherent</i>, which, of course,
literally means “sticking in.” By anything inherent we
mean that which was there from the first as part and<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_110" id="p_110">[110]</a></span>
parcel of, as indeed essential to, the entity to which we
refer. Now inherent characters are always inherited in
the accurate sense that they inhere in the germ-cells,
which are the inherited material. As these germ-cells
make us or as we are made out of them, it follows, of
course, that all our potentialities whatsoever, our ultimate
fates in every particular, partly depend upon inheritance.<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p><i>Nature</i> and <i>nurture</i> are antithetic terms of Shakespearean
origin which are in frequent use and much
favoured by Mr. Galton. That which comes by nature
is the inborn, inherent, or germinal; and that is due to
nurture which is the result of the converse of the germinal
with the environment&mdash;a man's accent, for instance.</p>

<p>Perhaps, in some ways, <i>germinal</i> is the most useful
word of all, though inherent is so convenient and familiar,
as well as being accurate etymologically, that it has been
employed throughout this book. Not only is the word
germinal strictly accurate, but also it suggests the idea
of the germ-plasm, and has the particular virtue of
avoiding all reference to the change of environment to
which young mammals are subjected and which is called
birth.</p>

<p>There remains the terminological difficulty that, as I
have tried to show, the individual may display characters
which were potential in the germ, inherent and necessarily
inherited, though they did not appear in the parent nor
yet in any ancestor. We have to face the paradox, then,
that in natural inheritance a parent can transmit what
he has not got, though this does not apply to the unnatural
inheritance of property in human society. Now
what word is there which shall indicate the origin or at<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_111" id="p_111">[111]</a></span>
least the time and conditions of origin, of such characters
as these? They are germinal, yet they are&mdash;in some
cases&mdash;not wholly present in either of the germ-cells which
united to form the new individual in question. They
are present, however, in the new single cell from which
this individual, like every living organism, takes its
origin.<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> The terms “congerminal” or “conceptional”
might be employed.</p>

<p>“Acquired character,” even, is a bad term. It replaced
“functionally-produced modification,” which was
long employed by Spencer. The blacksmith's biceps
answers to this phrase. It is this and other such modifications
that are non-transmissible. Alcoholic degeneration
is not a “functionally-produced modification,” but
it is an “acquired character,” as is lead poisoning. These
do produce results in offspring&mdash;naturally enough. If the
older phrase were still the one employed, we should see
that the Weismannian argument as to non-transmission
does not apply to <i>such</i> “acquired characters.”</p>

<p>The word “reversion,” also, not to say “atavism,”
may well be dropped. The attempted justification of its
older meaning by Professor Thomson has led to severe
and conclusive Mendelian criticism. The “reversion” of
fancy pigeons to the blue ancestor is simply due to the
coming together of Mendelian units long separated. The
“reversion” of the feeble-minded is not reversion but the
result of poisoning&mdash;<i>di</i>version, or <i>per</i>version, if you like.
Primitive man was not feeble-minded, nor is the ape.
Science has no further use for the word as it is at present
employed.</p>

<p><em class="psection">Maternal impressions.</em>&mdash;We are now, at last, after
our attempt to clear up the vocabulary of heredity, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_112" id="p_112">[112]</a></span>
a position to consider certain doctrines and popular
beliefs which bear very directly upon race-culture.
Realising, for instance, that “congenital” means nothing;
realising as perhaps some of us have not so clearly realised
before, <i>when</i> exactly it is that the new human being comes
into existence, we shall be prepared to understand how
definite and indisputable are the denials which science
offers to certain popular ideas.</p>

<p>Thus, for instance, in the interests of race-culture, or, to
be more particular, in the interests of her unborn baby, the
expectant mother may faithfully follow the example of
Lucy in <i>The Ordeal of Richard Feverel</i>.<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> Does this have its
intended effect? The answer is an unqualified negative.
Consider the case. The baby is at this time already a baby,
though rather small and uncanny, floating in a fluid of its
own manufacture. Its sole connection with its mother is
by means of its umbilical cord&mdash;that is to say, blood vessels,
arterial and venous. There is no nervous connection
whatever: absolutely nothing but the blood-stream,
carried along a system of tubes. This blood is the child's
blood, which it sends forth from itself along the umbilical
cord to a special organ, the placenta or after-birth, half
made by itself and half made by the mother, in which
the child's blood travels in thin vessels so close to the
mother's blood that their contents can be interchanged.
Yet the two streams never actually mix. The child's
blood, having disposed of its carbonic acid and waste-products
to the mother's blood, and having received
therefrom oxygen and food, returns so laden to the child.
Pray how is the mother's reading of history to make the
child a historian? If, after birth, a small operation were<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_113" id="p_113">[113]</a></span>
performed, so that some of the mother's blood should
run along an artificial tube into one of her baby's veins,
the effective connection between the two organisms would
in a sense be actually closer than it was before birth, when,
as has been said, the two streams are always kept apart.
Should we expect such an operation to serve the child for
education? If the mother then acquired a scar should
we expect it to give the child a similar scar?</p>

<p>We see now why the learning of geometry on the part of
the mother before its birth will not set her baby upon that
royal road to geometry of which Euclid rightly denied the
existence&mdash;any more than after its birth. Such a thing
does not happen, and there is no conceivable means by
which it could happen&mdash;unless we are to call in telepathy.
All maternal hopes and efforts of this kind are utterly
misguided: as misguided as if the father entertained
similar hopes. Let the devoted mother acquaint herself
not with what historians are pleased to call history, but
with the history of the developing human mind and body,
so that she may be a fit educator of her child when it is
born.</p>

<p>Let her also realise that her blood is everything to her
child. It is food and air and organ of excretion. If she
introduces alcohol into her blood in any considerable
quantity she is feeding her child on poisoned food. Surely
the reader must see the distinction between a case like
this and the supposed transmission of historical knowledge
or even historical aptitude from mother to baby by
the diligent perusal of histories. Yet though the distinction
is so palpable and evident, there are extremists
who believe and even print their beliefs that the denial
of the one (supposed) possibility, which is palpably inconceivable,
logically carries with it a denial of the other
possibility, which is indeed a palpable necessity. Or,
to state the criticism in another way, there are those who,<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_114" id="p_114">[114]</a></span>
if we protest that the introduction of poisons into the
mother's organism must surely involve risk to the child
who is nourished by her blood, will retort, “Oh, well, I
suppose you believe that if you learn a number of languages
before your next child is born, he or she will be a
linguist!”<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p><em class="psection">Hereditary genius.</em>&mdash;Mr. Galton's world-famous work
on <i>Hereditary Genius</i> was published in 1869 and reprinted
with a most valuable additional chapter in 1892. It
has long been out of print, however, and for the definite
purpose of attempting to arouse the reader's interest
in it so that he may somehow or other obtain a
copy to read, I may here go over one or two points,
chosen to that end. The argument, of course, is that
ability is hereditary.<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>This, in the judgment of most unbiassed people, Mr.
Galton conclusively proved: and we do not at all realise
to-day how repugnant and revolutionary this doctrine
appeared to popular opinion some forty years ago. Mr.
Galton has, however, followed up his citation of facts
on more than one occasion since,<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> and those who now
deny his view belong to that very large majority of
any population which finds itself able to pronounce
confidently upon the value of an author's work without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_115" id="p_115">[115]</a></span>the labour, found necessary by less fortunate people, of
reading it.</p>

<p>The following quotation states the question of national
eugenics in final form:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“As an example of what could be sought with advantage, let
us suppose that we take a number, sufficient for statistical purposes,
of persons occupying different social classes, those who are
the least efficient in physical, intellectual, and moral grounds
forming our lowest class, and those who are the most efficient
forming our highest class. The question to be solved relates to
the hereditary permanence of the several classes. What proportion
of each class is descended from parents who belong to the
same class, and what proportion is descended from parents who
belong to each of the other classes? Do those persons who have
honourably succeeded in life, and who are presumably, on the
whole, the most valuable portion of our human stock, contribute
on the aggregate their fair share of posterity to the next generation?
If not, do they contribute more or less than their fair
share, and in what degree? In other words, is the evolution
of man in each particular country favourably or injuriously
affected by its special form of civilisation?</p>

<p>“Enough is already known to make it certain that the productiveness
of both the extreme classes, the best and the worst,
falls short of the average of the nation as a whole. Therefore,
the most prolific class necessarily lies between the two extremes,
but at what intermediate point does it lie? Taken altogether, on
any reasonable principle, are the natural gifts of the most prolific
class, bodily, intellectual, and moral, above or below the line of
national mediocrity? If above that line, then the existing conditions
are favourable to the improvement of the race. If they
are below that line, they must work towards its degradation.”</p></div>

<p>The main body of the book deals with enquiries in
special cases&mdash;the judges of England between 1660 and
1865, statesmen, commanders, authors, men of science,
poets, musicians, painters, divines, senior classics of
Cambridge, oarsmen and wrestlers.</p>

<p>The concluding chapters should be printed in gold.
Only one or two notes can here be made. Mr. Galton<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_116" id="p_116">[116]</a></span>
believes that the dark ages were largely due to the celibacy
enjoined by religious orders on their votaries:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Whenever a man or woman was possessed of a gentle nature
that fitted him or her to deeds of charity, to meditation, to literature
or to art, the social condition of the time was such that they
had no refuge elsewhere than in the bosom of the Church. But
the Church chose to preach and exact celibacy, and the consequence
was that these gentle natures had no continuance, and
thus, by a policy so singularly unwise and suicidal that I am
hardly able to speak of it without impatience, the Church
brutalised the breed of our forefathers. She acted precisely as if
she had aimed at selecting the rudest portion of the community
to be, alone, parents of future generations. She practised the arts
which breeders would use, who aimed at creating ferocious,
currish, and stupid natures. No wonder that club law prevailed
for centuries over Europe; the wonder rather is that enough good
remained in the veins of Europeans to enable their race to rise to
its present very moderate level of natural morality.”</p></div>

<p>Yet further:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The policy of the religious world in Europe was exerted in
another direction, with hardly less cruel effect on the nature of
future generations, by means of persecutions which brought
thousands of the foremost thinkers and men of political aptitudes
to the scaffold, or imprisoned them during a large part of their
manhood, or drove them as emigrants into other lands. In every
one of these cases the check upon their leaving issue was very
considerable. Hence the Church, having first captured all the
gentle natures and condemned them to celibacy, made another
sweep of her huge nets, this time fishing in stirring waters, to
catch those who were the most fearless, truth-seeking, and intelligent,
in their modes of thought, and therefore the most suitable
parents of a high civilisation, and put a strong check, if not a
direct stop, to their progeny. Those she reserved on these
occasions, to breed the generations of the future, were the servile,
the indifferent, and, again, the stupid. Thus, as she&mdash;to repeat
my expression&mdash;brutalised human nature by her system of celibacy
applied to the gentle, she demoralised it by her system of persecution
of the intelligent, the sincere, and the free. It is enough to
make the blood boil to think of the blind folly that has caused<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_117" id="p_117">[117]</a></span>
the foremost nations of struggling humanity to be the heirs of
such hateful ancestry, and that has so bred our instincts as to keep
them in an unnecessarily long-continued antagonism with the
essential requirements of a steadily advancing civilisation.”</p></div>

<p>For this final quotation no apology is needed:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The best form of civilisation in respect to the improvement of
the race, would be one in which society was not costly; where
incomes were chiefly derived from professional sources, and not much
through inheritance; where every lad had a chance of showing
his abilities, and, if highly gifted, was enabled to achieve a first-class
education and entrance into professional life, by the liberal
help of the exhibitions and scholarships which he had gained in
his early youth; where marriage was held in as high honour as in
ancient Jewish times; where the pride of race was encouraged
(of course I do not refer to the nonsensical sentiment of the
present day, that goes under that name); where the weak could
find a welcome and a refuge in celibate monasteries or sisterhoods,
and lastly, where the better sort of emigrants and refugees from
other lands were invited and welcomed, and their descendants
naturalised.”</p></div>

<p><em class="psection">The study of psychical inheritance.</em>&mdash;This early work of
Mr. Galton has been followed by much more on the same
lines. Contemporary psychology, however, is <i>just beginning</i>
to indicate the lines on which new enquiry is needed.
The naïve assertions of the actuary as to the inheritance
of, say, “conscientiousness” are not useful to the psychologist,
who has some idea of the structure and history of
that most complex social product we call conscience. The
psychologists must analyse out for us those elementary
units of the mind upon which experience and the social
state, education and suggestion act, to make human nature
as we know it. The reader may be directed to Dr.
McDougall's recent work on <i>Social Psychology</i>&mdash;written
at the present writer's suggestion&mdash;for an outline analysis
of what is really inherent, and therefore alone transmissible,
in the human mind&mdash;certain instincts and<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_118" id="p_118">[118]</a></span>
impulses, together with native varieties in capacity of
memory, and so on. Recently the Mendelians have
entered this field, and they have the advantage of
realising the importance of dealing with real primary
units. Their law seems to apply to the musical sense in
man and to the brooding instinct in the hen.<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> The line
of study here suggested is earnestly commended to the
psychologists for their <i>indispensable</i> help.</p>

<p><em class="psection">Eugenics and parties.</em>&mdash;Let us once again consider the
fashion in which men and women are classified to the
eugenic eye. We have already realised that the most essential
division <i>of fact</i> is that between those who will and
those who will not be parents. The most essential division
<i>of ideal</i> is of those who are worthy and those who are not
worthy to be parents. It is the object of eugenics to make
the real and the ideal divisions coincide. And let us here
say with all possible force that before such classifications
as these all others are trivial and nearly all others impudent.
The eugenist has nothing to do with the low
game called party politics: terms like socialism and so
forth mean very little for him. He may or may not be a
socialist, but if he be, at least he does not subscribe to
what, so far as I can judge, is the first article in the creed
of socialism&mdash;that all evil is of economic origin; he knows
that there is much evil of germinal origin. As for
conservatism and liberalism, he might have some use for
these terms if the creed of conservatism were that there is
no wealth but life, which must be conserved; and the
creed of liberalism that life has not yet reached its zenith,
and there must be liberty for all progressive variations
of body and mind and thought and practice. As it is, all
these things are somewhat nauseating. If and when there
is a thinking party, and that party will have the eugenist,
he will doubtless join it. Meanwhile he appeals to that<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_119" id="p_119">[119]</a></span>
great and growing section of the community which knows
party-politics for the humbug and sham that it is, and the
House of Commons as a lethal chamber for souls.</p>

<p>Similarly, the eugenic classification of mankind cuts
right across the ordinary social classification. The parasite
and the parent of parasites must be branded, whether
he be at the top or the bottom of the social scale. The
quality of the germ-plasm which men and women carry is
the supremely important thing. Its architecture is the
architect of all empires. Year by year we shall more
surely be able to infer the nature and the worth of the
germ-plasm in particular cases, though its host may have
been veneered or, on the other hand, repressed; and year
by year the basal facts of heredity will furnish ever surer
criteria for the theory and practice of a New Imperialism
which knows, for instance, what militarism did for Rome
and Napoleon for France, and which will some day sweep
all the money changers out of the Temple of Life.<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<small>EDUCATION AND RACE-CULTURE</small></h3>

<div class="chapterblock">

<p>“Education is but the giving or withholding of opportunity.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bateson.</span></p></div>


<p>It is true that education can seem to accomplish miracles;
that in a single generation the results of an ideal education
would be amazing. It is true, also, that in certain
epochs of history, when wise counsels have prevailed, great
results have been attained. It is true that at present
scarcely a man or woman amongst us, if any, has reached
the full stature which would have been attained under an
ideal system of education. It is true, finally, that no
system of race-culture can ignore education or be effective
without it. Though the general question of education is
not the specific question of the present volume, yet there
is only too good reason for some brief allusion to the subject
here, especially since it bears on the question of the
measure of importance which we ascribe to heredity.</p>

<p><em class="psection">Modern education&mdash;the destruction of mind.</em>&mdash;When we
observe in such contrasted cases as those of Herbert
Spencer and Wordsworth, for instance, that absence of
early education, especially in the first septennium, has
co-existed with the subsequent efflorescence of the
mightiest genius, we may almost be inclined to enquire
whether genius could not in effect be made to order even
in the very next generation by the simple device of suspending
the process which we are pleased to call education.
Doubtless that is scarcely so, though every one who has
any knowledge of the subject is well assured that mere<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_121" id="p_121">[121]</a></span>
suspension of the present destructive process might suffice
to produce a population that would wonder at its ancestors.</p>

<p>A simple analogy will show the disastrous character of
the present process, which may be briefly described as
“education” by cram and emetic. It is as if you filled
a child's stomach to repletion with marbles, pieces of coal
and similar material incapable of digestion&mdash;the more
worthless the material the more accurate the analogy:
then applied an emetic and estimated your success by the
completeness with which everything was returned, more
especially if it was returned “unchanged,” as the doctors
say. Just so do we cram the child's mental stomach, its
memory, with a selection of dead facts of history and the
like (at least when they are not fictions) and then apply a
violent emetic called an examination (which like most
other emetics causes much depression) and estimate our
success by the number of statements which the child
vomits on to the examination paper&mdash;if the reader will
excuse me. Further, if we are what we usually are, we
prefer that the statements shall come back “unchanged”&mdash;showing
no signs of mental digestion. We call this
“training the memory.”</p>

<p>Such a process as one has imagined in the physical case
would assuredly ruin the physical digestion for life. In
the mental case, which is not imaginary but actual, a
similar result ensues. It is thus unfair to the Anglo-Saxon
germ-plasm to credit it with the abundant stupidity of its
products. Much of this stupidity is factitious and artificial.
We shall continue to produce it so long as by
education or drawing forth we understand intrusion or
thrusting in, and so long as the only drawing forth which
we practise is by means of the emetics we call examinations.
The present type of education is a curse to modern
childhood and a menace to the future. The teacher who
cannot tell whether a child is doing well without formally<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_122" id="p_122">[122]</a></span>
examining it, should be heaving bricks; but such a teacher
does not exist. In Berlin they are now learning that the
depression caused by these emetics, for which the best
physical parallel is antimony, often leads to child suicide&mdash;a
steadily-increasing phenomenon mainly due to educational
over-pressure and worry about examinations.</p>

<p>Short of such appalling disasters, however, we have to
reckon with the existence of this enormous amount of
stupidity, which those who fortunately escaped such
education in childhood have to drag along with them in
the long struggle towards the stars. This dead weight of
inertia lamentably retards progress.</p>

<p>Our factitious stupidity is injurious both in the governing
and the governed. As Professor Patrick Geddes once
remarked to the present writer, there are three kinds of
governments: the government of the future&mdash;as yet only
ideal, which believes that there are ideas and that they may
be worth acting upon: the second is instanced by the
Russian government, which believes that there are ideas,
but fears and suppresses them: the third by the British
government, which denies that there are ideas at all, and
prefers the method of “muddling through”&mdash;to use a
Cabinet Minister's contented phrase&mdash;though truth is one
and error infinite, though there are a million ways of going
wrong for one of going right. This characteristic is not
to be attributed to any germinal stupidity of the ruling
classes in England. If it were we should of course look
upon the decadence of their birth-rate with the utmost
gratitude. It is a factitious product of their education.
If you have been treated with marbles and emetics long
enough, you may begin to question whether there is such
a thing as nourishing food; if you have been crammed
with dead facts, and then compelled to disgorge them,
you may well question whether there are such things as
nourishing facts or ideas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p_123" id="p_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>Not less disastrous is this factitious stupidity amongst
the governed. It produces, of course, the kind of man
with whom we are all familiar. Having at great labour
been taught to read, he is incapable of reading anything
but rubbish. He never thinks for himself, and if he does
you wish he had not, so inadequate is his machinery and
so deplorable the result. He believes in politicians. He
is, as we have said, so much dead weight for the reformer,
whose energy is diverted from the discovery of new truth
by the need of directing the eyes of stupidity to the old,
though it shines as the sun in his strength.</p>

<p>Therefore, let not the reader suppose that in the advocacy
of eugenics or race-culture we have become blinded
to the possibilities offered us by reasonable education even
of the very heterogeneous material offered us by heredity.</p>

<p><em class="psection">The limits of education&mdash;individual and racial.</em>&mdash;Yet
it must be maintained that, though we cannot do without
education, and though something infinitely better than
we practise at present will be necessary if the ideal of race-culture
is ever to be realised, yet education alone, however
good, can never enable us to achieve our end. It must
be maintained, in the first place, that education is limited
in its powers by the inherent nature of the educated
material&mdash;it is a process of <i>drawing out</i>, and you cannot
draw out what is not there: and secondly, that its value,
so far as the nature of individuals is concerned, is confined
to the individuals in question and is not reproduced or
maintained in their children. Thus education alone would
have similar material to act upon from age to age, would
have to make a fresh beginning in each generation, and its
results, however good, relatively, would still be limited
and finite. We shall do well, perhaps, to obtain and retain
an adequate definition of education. No true conception
of education was possible, notwithstanding the derivation
of the word, so long as the child's mind was likened to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_124" id="p_124">[124]</a></span>
piece of “pure white paper” for us to write upon: or an
empty box waiting to be filled. The <i>tabula rasa</i> of Locke
is, we now know, the last thing in the world to resemble a
child's mind. Indeed, if any such figure be demanded,
the child's mind is a piece of mosaic&mdash;made of ancestral
pieces&mdash;and education is the process of realising what is
so given. Or, if a child's mind is a portmanteau, to
educate is not to pack but to unpack it. We understand,
at least, that education never can begin at the beginning,
nor anywhere near it&mdash;that, as Professor MacCunn says
in his admirable book, <i>The Making of Character</i>, “the page
of the youngest life is so far from being blank that it bears
upon it characters in comparison with which the faded
ink of palæography is as recent history.”</p>

<p>We are learning, too, though none but the very few know
this, that the process by which the “faded ink” is made
visible must not be credited with having done the writing:
any more than the fire to which you hold a paper written
upon with ink that fire makes visible. Still less do we
realise that what really seems to be the product of education
is often the result of an inherent mechanism now
developed, which was not yet formed when we began the
educational process. One reason why the baby cannot
walk is that it has not the nervous apparatus. A child
may walk at the first attempt, if that attempt be delayed
until the machinery is developed. A child may similarly
speak sentences at the first attempt. Very commonly we
start teaching a child something, which, after some years,
it learns. We have done nothing but interfere. The learning
is none of our doing: merely the mental apparatus is
now evolved&mdash;and lo! the result. At birth the sucking
apparatus is perfect. If we could, doubtless we should
start teaching the unborn infant to suck long before the
machinery was ready&mdash;and should applaud ourselves for
its facility at birth; only that probably this facility would<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_125" id="p_125">[125]</a></span>
be impaired by our efforts, as many capacities of later
development are damaged by our interference. What we
understand, or misunderstand, by education should begin
approximately when a child is seven. The first seven years
of life should really have the term of childhood confined
to them, for there is a natural term so indicated. The
growth of the brain is a matter of the first seven years
almost wholly. It grows relatively little after that period;
and until that is completed the physical apparatus of
mind is not ready for educational interference. Without
any such interference, and with merely the provision of
conditions, physical and mental, for its spontaneous
development, the brain of the seven year old will suffice
for surprising things&mdash;so surprising that if their evolution
were possible under any system of schooling practised
before that date, we should applaud it as ideal. Probably
there is no such system&mdash;much less any that will improve
on the spontaneous process.</p>

<p><em class="psection">Education the provision of an environment.</em>&mdash;We
are prepared, then, to realise the limits to the action of
education upon the individual. We shall not confuse
this great and many-sided thing with such of its factors
as instruction or schooling. It is not intrusion but
education: “the guidance of growth,” to use Sir James
Crichton-Browne's phrase. This guidance, this process
of unpacking, educing or realising, is accomplished
by the action of circumstances or the environment.
Environment is a large word and is invariably abused
when it is used in less than the large sense. Here it
includes, for instance, air and food, mother-love and
the schoolmaster. I therefore define education as <i>the
provision of an environment</i>. This definition prepares
us to understand the limitations of the process. If we
think of education as a packing or cramming process,
we shall err in this respect; we shall expect limitless<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_126" id="p_126">[126]</a></span>
results from education provided that one packs early
and tightly and carefully enough. It is this erroneous
conception which rules us and daily betrays us in practice.
If, however, we think of education as the provision of
an environment, capable of creating nothing, but merely
of causing the expression or the repression of potential
characters inherent in the individual educated, then we
shall begin to recast our methods on the lines determined
by this truth. Yet, further, we shall begin to understand
the cardinal truth, one of the many platitudes which
we have yet to appreciate, that “you cannot make a
silk purse out of a sow's ear.”</p>

<p><em class="psection">Heredity and environment.</em>&mdash;Let us consider the question
in general terms. The characters of any living thing
are determined by two factors&mdash;heredity and environment.
The old phrases were character and circumstances, but
they were less than useful, since character is modified
by circumstances. Now one of the most important
questions in the world, and not least for the eugenist,
is as to the relative importance of these two factors.
The technical terms may not be in our mouths, but we
discuss this instance or that of the question in point almost
every day of our lives. One part of the business of
philosophy and of science is not only to answer questions
but to ask them correctly. This question is always
wrongly asked, and therefore cannot be answered, or
is incorrectly answered. We persist in using the
mathematical idea of addition, and we seek to show that,
say, seventy per cent. of the result is due to the innate
factor and thirty per cent. to the acquired. But the
truth is that so long as we begin with this idea we may
prove what we please. If we keep our attention fixed
upon the environmental or educational factor we can
easily and correctly demonstrate that in certain circumstances
Mozart would have been tone-deaf and Shakespeare<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_127" id="p_127">[127]</a></span>
a gibbering idiot&mdash;hence, but incorrectly, we
argue that environment is practically everything. <i>Per
contra</i>, we can easily and correctly demonstrate that no
education in the world could enable a door-mat or a
cabbage or ourselves to write <i>Don Giovanni</i> or <i>Hamlet</i>&mdash;hence,
but incorrectly, we argue that the material to be
operated upon is everything. We have to learn, however,
that the analogy <i>is one not of addition but of multiplication</i>.
Neither inheritance nor environment, as such, gives anything.
The environmental factor may be potentially
one hundred&mdash;an ideal education&mdash;but the innate or
inherited factor may be nothing, as when the pupil is a
door-mat or a fool. The result then is nothing. Darwin
had the trombone played to a plant, but he did not make
a Palestrina. No academy of music will make a beetroot
into a Beethoven, though I dare say a well-trained beetroot
might write a musical comedy. The point is that
one hundred multiplied by nothing equals nothing.
Similarly, the innate factor may be one hundred, as in
the case of a potential genius, but he may be brought
up upon alcohol and curses amongst savages, and the
result again is nothing. Keep the idea of multiplication
in the mind, and the facts are seen rightly. No matter
how big either factor be, if it be multiplied by nothing
it yields nothing, or if it be multiplied by a fraction, as
in the ordinary education of a genius, it yields less than
it should. But in this controversy people persist in
assuming that inheritance or education gives definitely
so much which is there anyhow, whereas, really, it only
supplies a potential figure, which may realise infinity or
nothing, according to what it is multiplied by. With
all deference, I submit this as a real answer to these
endless disputes.</p>

<p>But further, granted that neither factor in itself produces
any actuality, which is normally the weightier of<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_128" id="p_128">[128]</a></span>
the two factors? We must make the qualification,
“normally,” because such a thing as disease or poison,
included in the environmental factor, will dominate
the result, completely overshadowing the importance
of whatever heredity gave. Such things apart, however,
we may be thoroughly assured that heredity is the
weightier of the two factors. The more we study
education, the more we recognise its true nature.
Indeed, the more we realise its ideal, the more do we
realise its limitations. The more we study education
the more important does heredity appear. If the
reader has not had opportunities of observing children
for himself let him refer to such a book as Mr. Galton's
<i>Inquiries into Human Faculty</i>, and he will begin to realise
how large is the factor given by inheritance and how
relatively small is the factor given by education.</p>

<p><em class="psection">Education can educate only what heredity gives.</em>&mdash;Heredity,
as the eugenist must never forget, gives not
actualities but only potentialities. It depends upon
circumstances whether they shall become actualities.
That, however, we all know. No one supposes that
education is superfluous or impotent. We do, however,
persistently forget the converse truth that education,
on the other hand, makes no definite contribution, but
merely multiplies&mdash;or alas, divides&mdash;the potentialities
given by inheritance. These potentialities constitute a
limiting condition which no education can transcend.
Education can educate only what heredity gives. Long
ago Helvetius thought, as did Kant, that the differences
between men were due to differences in education. But it is
not so. We make, of course, the most ridiculous claims for
education. The remark wrongly attributed to the Duke
of Wellington, that “the battle of Waterloo was won
on the playing-fields of Eton,” is an instance in point.
Recently, when Francis Thompson, the poet, died, the local<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_129" id="p_129">[129]</a></span>
newspaper of his birthplace said that it should be proud
to have produced him. We may laugh at this conception
of the genesis of genius, but we all talk in this
fashion. A genius was educated at Eton, and we say
that Eton produced him. The truth is, of course, that
Eton failed to destroy him. (One says Eton for convenience,
but the name of any accepted school will do.)
If Eton produced him, why does not it produce thousands
like him? There is plenty of material: but it is not
the right material. We should cease to speak, in our
pride for our own <i>Alma Mater</i> or our own methods, as
if education created genius or anything else. Men
are born unequal. To realise the nature of education
is not only to avoid the popular assumption that an
ideal education will do everything for us, forgetting
that no amount of polishing will make pewter shine like
silver; it is not only to send us back to the principle
of selection in recognition of the power of inheritance;
it is not merely to dispose of the idea that men are born
inherently equal; but it is also to combat the idea
that education is a levelling process. On the contrary,
it accentuates the differences between men. You may
confuse the unpolished pebble and the diamond, but not
when education has done its utmost for both. If education
were a process of addition to what inheritance gives,
it would almost level men: the addition of a large sum
to figures such as, say, 1, 2, and 3, would almost obliterate
their original disproportion. But the analogy is with
multiplication, as I have suggested: and the larger the
sum by which 1, 2 and 3 are multiplied, the greater is
the disparity between the products. This is, perhaps,
one of the truths of vast importance which the common
rim of contemporary Socialism implicitly denies: though
it is of course abundantly recognised by such a socialist
as that master-thinker Professor Forel. The socialist's<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_130" id="p_130">[130]</a></span>
panacea, ideal education for all, is much to be desired,
and will accomplish much, as we began by admitting;
but it is not a panacea. Those who believe it to be
such do not understand the nature of education nor its
limitations. They should remember the remark of
Epictetus, “the condition and characteristic of a fool
is this: he never expects from himself profit nor harm,
but from externals.” The dogma of the unthinking
socialist&mdash;who exists, though he is doubtless rarer than
the unthinking individualist&mdash;is that all evil is of economic
origin: correct your economics and your education and
you obliterate evil. But it is not so. As Lowell said,
“A great part of human suffering has its root in the
nature of man, and not in that of his institutions.”
When by means of eugenics we can give education the
right material to work upon, we shall have a Utopia, and
as for forms of government they may be left for fools to
contest. Forel, incomparably the greatest socialist thinker
of the day, sees this. He makes his Utopian predictions
not so much as to mere externals, like clothing and
language, but as regards the kind of man and woman:
and, unlike some writers, he entitles himself to paint
these pictures, for in that great eugenic treatise
<i>Die Sexuel Frage</i>, he tells us how to realise them by
pedagogic reform working upon the materials provided
by human selection. A paragraph may be quoted from
Forel:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Malgré tout l'enthousiasme qu'on doit montrer pour une
pédagogie rationelle, il ne faut jamais oublier qu'elle est incapable
de remplacer la sélection. Elle sert au but immédiat et
rapproché, qui est d'utiliser le mieux possible le matérial
humain tel qu'il existe maintenant. Mais, par elle-même, elle
n'améliore en rien la qualité des germes à venir. Elle peut,
néanmoins, grâce à l'instruction donnée à la jeunesse sur la
valeur sociale de la sélection, la préparer à mettre cette dernière
en œuvre.”</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p_131" id="p_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>and another from Spencer:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We are not among those who believe in Lord Palmerston's
dogma, that all children are born good. On the whole, the
opposite dogma, untenable as it is, seems to us less wide of the
truth. Nor do we agree with those who think that, by skilful
discipline, children may be made altogether what they should be.
Contrariwise, we are satisfied that though imperfections of nature
may be diminished by wise management, they cannot be removed
by it. The notion that an ideal humanity might be forthwith
produced by a perfect system of education, is near akin to that
implied in the poems of Shelley, that would make mankind give
up their old institutions and prejudices, all the evils in the world
would at once disappear; neither notion being acceptable to such
as have dispassionately studied human affairs.”</p></div>

<p><em class="psection">Ruskin on education and inequality.</em>&mdash;Three great
paragraphs may be quoted from Ruskin's <i>Time and
Tide</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“... Education <i>was desired by the lower orders because they
thought it would make them upper orders</i>, and be a leveller and
effacer of distinctions. They will be mightily astonished, when
they really get it, to find that it is, on the contrary, the fatallest
of all discerners and enforcers of distinctions; piercing, even to
the division of the joints and marrow, to find out wherein your
body and soul are less, or greater, than other bodies and souls,
and to sign deed of separation with unequivocal seal.</p>

<p>“171. Education is, indeed, of all differences not divinely
appointed, an instant effacer and reconciler. Whatever is undivinely
poor, it will make rich; whatever is undivinely maimed,
and halt, and blind, it will make whole, and equal, and seeing.
The blind and the lame are to it as to David at the siege of the
Tower of the Kings, ‘hated of David's soul.’ But there are
other divinely-appointed differences, eternal as the ranks of the
everlasting hills, and as the strength of their ceaseless waters.
And these, education does not do away with; but measures,
manifests, and employs.</p>

<p>“In the handful of shingle which you gather from the sea-beach,
which the indiscriminate sea, with equality of fraternal
foam, has only educated to be, every one, round, you will see<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_132" id="p_132">[132]</a></span>
little difference between the noble and the mean stones. But the
jeweller's trenchant education of them will tell you another story.
Even the meanest will be the better for it, but the noblest so
much better that you can class the two together no more. The
fair veins and colours are all clear now, and so stern is nature's
intent regarding this, that not only will the polish show which is
best, but the best will take most polish. You shall not merely see
they have more virtue than the others, but see that more of virtue
more clearly; and the less virtue there is, the more dimly you shall
see what there is of it.</p>

<p>“172. And the law about education, which is sorrowfullest to
vulgar pride, is this&mdash;that all its gains are at compound interest;
so that, as our work proceeds, every hour throws us farther
behind the greater men with whom we began on equal terms.
Two children go to school hand in hand, and spell for half an
hour over the same page. Through all their lives, never shall
they spell from the same page more. One is presently a page
a-head, two pages, ten pages&mdash;and evermore, though each toils
equally, the interval enlarges&mdash;at birth nothing, at death infinite.”</p></div>

<p>So much for one relation of this question to Socialism.
Quite lately (<i>The New Age</i>, April 11th, 1908) Mr. Havelock
Ellis has summed the matter up as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Education has been put at the beginning, when it ought to
have been put at the end. It matters comparatively little what
sort of education we give children; the primary matter is what
sort of children we have got to educate. That is the most
fundamental of questions. It lies deeper even than the great
question of Socialism versus Individualism, and indeed touches a
foundation that is common to both. The best organised social
system is only a house of cards if it cannot be constructed with
sound individuals; and no individualism worth the name is
possible, unless a sound social organisation permits the breeding
of individuals who count. On this plane Socialism and Individualism
move in the same circle.”</p></div>

<p>We cannot agree with Socialism when, as we think,
it assumes that all evil is of economic or of educational
origin. The student of heredity finds elements of evil<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_133" id="p_133">[133]</a></span>
abundant in poisoned germ-plasm and not absent from
the best. Surely, surely, the products of progress are
not mechanisms but men; and surely no economic
system as such can be the only mechanism worth naming&mdash;which
would be one that made men. The germ-plasm
is such a mechanism, indeed; and hence its quality is
all important.</p>

<p>But if Socialism, sooner than any other party, is going
to identify itself with the economic principle of Ruskin
that “there is no wealth but life”; and if in its discussion
of the conditions of industry it will concern itself primarily
with the culture of the racial life, which is the vital
industry of any people (and basis enough for a New
Imperialism, or at least a New Patriotism, that might
be quite decent); if so, then it seems to me that we must
look to the socialists for salvation. But books which
describe future externals, books which assume that
education is a panacea, forgetting that education can
educate only what heredity gives, turn us away again
when we are almost persuaded. The <i>economic</i> panacea
must fail (at least as a panacea); the <i>educational</i> panacea
must fail; the <i>eugenic</i> panacea may not fail.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Education, then, cannot achieve our ideal of race-culture.
No matter how good our polishing, we must
have silver and diamonds to work upon, not pewter
and pebbles. When we have the right material to
work upon, our labour will not be wasted, or far worse
than wasted, as it now too often is.</p>

<p><em class="psection">Education a Sisyphean task.</em>&mdash;But the belief in
education as in itself an adequate instrument of race-culture
chiefly depends upon the popular doctrine as
to its influence upon the race. It is supposed, in a word,
that if we educate the parents, the child will begin<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_134" id="p_134">[134]</a></span>
where the parents left off. This is the doctrine of
Lamarck, who said that if the necks of the parent giraffe
were educated or drawn out, the baby giraffe would have
this anatomical acquirement transmitted to it, and, so
to speak, when it grew up, would be able to begin feeding
on the leaves of trees at the level where its parents had
to leave off. In the course of its life its own neck would
become elongated or educated, and its children would outstretch
both itself and their grand-parents. This doctrine
of the transmission of acquired characters by heredity,
as we have seen, is, at the present day, repudiated by
biologists. It is generally believed by the medical
profession and by the public, notwithstanding the fact
that, for instance, the skin of the heel of every new baby
is almost as thin and delicate as it is anywhere else,
though for unthinkable generations all the ancestors
of that baby on both sides have greatly thickened the
skin of both heels by the act of walking.</p>

<p>It is quite evident that, if the Lamarckian theory
were true, education would be a completely adequate
instrument of race-culture, incomparable in its rapidity
and certainty. It would not reform the world in a
single generation because, as we have seen, its results
would be limited by the inherent nature of its material;
but since those results would involve the vast amelioration
of the material upon which it worked in the second
generation, mankind would be little lower than the
angels in a century. The good habits acquired by one
generation would be innate in the next. If the father
learnt one language in addition to his own, the child
would start with the knowledge of two, waiting only
for opportunity, and could accumulate more and hand
them on to its child. “My father's environment would
be my heredity.” If we desired muscular strength we
could in two generations produce a race amongst whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_135" id="p_135">[135]</a></span>
Sandow would be a puny weakling. We should not need to
discuss any question of selection for parenthood. Without
any such process we could answer Browning's prayer and
“elevate the race at once”&mdash;physically, mentally and
morally.</p>

<p>But the Lamarckian theory does not correspond with
facts. The results of education, physical, mental, or
moral, are limited to the individuals educated. The
children do not begin where the parents left off, but
they make a fresh start where the parents did. Thus even
though we had and employed an ideal method of education,
we should make no permanent improvement by its means
alone in the breed of mankind, any more than the breeder
of race-horses could attain his end by the same means.
In each generation the same problem, the same difficulties,
the same limitations inherent in the nature of the new
material, would have to be faced. We must learn from
the horse-breeder, who knows that the blood of a single
horse, Eclipse, runs in the veins of the great majority of
winners since his time.</p>

<p>It is exceedingly difficult to dispossess the popular
mind of the Lamarckian idea, the more especially as
members of the medical profession, who are regarded
as authorities on heredity, contentedly accept this idea
themselves. Yet the advocates of eugenics or race-culture
have to recognise that, so long as the Lamarckian
idea obtains, their crusade will fail to find a hearing.
We believe that nothing can really be accomplished
in the way of race-culture until public opinion&mdash;that
“chaos of prejudices,” as Huxley called it&mdash;is marshalled
on our side. But the popular notion of heredity is a
most formidable obstacle. The Lamarckian idea seems
to provide a method for the improvement of a species
which cannot be surpassed for simplicity, rapidity and
certainty. It even excludes the possibility of mistakes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_136" id="p_136">[136]</a></span>
You cannot go wrong if you simply educate every one to
the utmost. Doubtless some persons are more suited for
parenthood than others, but only let education be wise and
universal, and any question of selection by marriage or
otherwise will be superfluous. A thousand difficulties
offered by public sentiment, by convention, by the
churches, by the large measure of uncertainty which
attends the working of heredity, could be ignored, if
race-culture were simply a matter of education.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, these difficulties have to be faced by
the eugenist. The popular misconception of heredity&mdash;instanced
by Sir James Simpson's belief, not inexcusable
sixty years ago, that the education of a future mother
will enlarge her child's brain&mdash;must be removed. It can
scarcely be doubted that the sway of the Lamarckian
idea will soon be diminished, and then, at last, those
who are interested in the future will discover that only by
the process of selection for parenthood, which has brought
mankind thus far, can further progress be assured.</p>

<p><em class="psection">Real functions of education for race-culture.</em>&mdash;Nevertheless
education has a true function for race-culture
in addition to the obvious fact of its necessity in
order to realise the inherent potentialities of the individual.
One of its functions is to provide a level of public opinion
and public taste such that the finer specimens of each generation
shall receive their due reward and shall not be
crushed out of existence or perverted. There is a passage
in Goethe which suggests the true function of education,
and makes us suspect that, so far as many kinds of genius
and talent are concerned, our immediate business is
perhaps less to endeavour to produce them by breeding&mdash;if
that be possible&mdash;than to make the most of them when
they are vouchsafed us. Says Goethe:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p_137" id="p_137">[137]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot">

<p>“We admire the Tragedies of the ancient Greeks; but to take a
correct view of the case, we ought to admire the period and the
nation in which their production was possible rather than the
individual authors; for though these pieces differ in some points
from each other, and though one of these poets appears somewhat
greater and more finished than the other, still, taking all things
together, only one decided character runs through the whole.</p>

<p>“This is the character of grandeur, fitness, soundness, human
perfection, elevated wisdom, sublime thought, pure, strong intuition,
and whatever other qualities one might enumerate. But
when we find all these qualities, not only in the dramatic works
which have come down to us, but also in lyrical and epic works&mdash;in
the philosophers, orators, and historians, and in an equally
high degree in the works of plastic art that have come down to
us&mdash;we must feel convinced that such qualities did not merely
belong to individuals, but were the current property of the nation
and the whole period.”</p></div>

<p><em class="psection">Education as to the principle of selection.</em>&mdash;Further, the
hope may be warranted that, though education, as such,
will not achieve the ideal of true race-culture, and though
it has never hitherto averted the ultimate failure of all
civilisations, yet the case may be different to-day, in that
our acquired or traditional progress, transmitted by the
process of education accumulating from age to age&mdash;not
in our blood and bone and brain, but mainly in books,
whereby the non-transmission of the results of education
is circumvented in a sense&mdash;has reached the point at
which the laws of racial or inherent progress have been
revealed to us, as to none of our predecessors.<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> Having
the knowledge of these laws it is possible that we may
avert our predecessors' fate by putting them into force.
If we do not, we must ultimately become “one with
Nineveh and Tyre.” Fifty years have now elapsed since
the principle of natural selection was demonstrated for
all time by the genius of Darwin. We must not be guilty
of starting to tell the story of organic evolution and
leaving out the point. So long as we supposed that man
was created as he is, the idea of racial progress was an<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_138" id="p_138">[138]</a></span>
absurdity. It is the correct thing now-a-days to decry
the possibility of human perfection. This possibility is
rightly to be decried if it be assumed that ideal education
of the present material or anything like it would realise
perfection. We have seen that it would not. It is the
principle of selection, in which Darwin has educated
us, that must be taught to all mankind, and thus
education may indeed become the factor of an effective
race-culture.</p>

<p><em class="psection">The power of individual opinion.</em>&mdash;Since ultimately
opinion rules the world, it is for us to create sound opinion.
That is the purpose of this book. But every individual
may be a centre of eugenic opinion, and the time has
assuredly come for attempting to realise this ideal,
though a thousand years should pass before the facts of
heredity are completely ascertained and understood.
The main principles are of the simplest character, and
can be readily imparted to a child. Especially does the
responsibility fall upon parents and those who are in
charge of childhood.</p>

<p>The young people of the next and all succeeding generations
must be taught the supreme sanctity of parenthood.
The little boy who asks what he is to become when he
grows up, must be taught that the highest profession and
privilege he can aspire to is responsible fatherhood; the
little girl may less frequently ask these questions, the
answer to which has been imparted to her by her own
Mother-Nature&mdash;as the doll instinct, so little appreciated
or utilised, sufficiently demonstrates; but she likewise
must be taught reverence for Motherhood. As childhood
gives place to youth, what may be called the eugenic
sense must be cultivated as a cardinal aspect of the moral
sense itself; so that even personal inclination&mdash;at the
controllable and self-controllable stage which precedes<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_139" id="p_139">[139]</a></span>
“head over ears” affection&mdash;will wither when it is
directed to some one who, on any ground, offends
the educated eugenic sense. There is here a field
for moral education of the highest and most valuable
kind, both for the individual and for the race.
Is there any other aspect of duty which can claim
a higher warrant? Is there any hitherto so wholly
ignored?</p>

<p>The preceding paragraph is re-printed from a brief
account of its objects written for the Eugenics Education
Society, as a Society which amongst other purposes
exists “to further eugenic teaching at home and in the
schools and elsewhere.” The difficulties of teaching
this subject to children are more apparent than real. I
may freely confess that though I have been speaking,
writing, and thinking about eugenics for six years, I did
not realise the importance of eugenic education until I
heard the views of some of the women who belong to this
Society, and even then I was at first sceptical as to its
practicability. The subject has been entirely ignored by
the pioneers of this matter. But if we turn to such a
work as Forel's masterpiece we begin to realise that the
eugenic education of children is the real beginning at the
beginning, that it is in fact indispensable, and must be
antecedent to all legislation in the direction of positive
eugenics, though not to certain forms of legislation in the
direction of negative eugenics.<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> In the earlier chapters
of his great work Professor Forel offers the parent and the
guardian abundant, detailed and accurate guidance as
to the lines and methods of this teaching. It is urgently
necessary for both sexes, but more especially for girls,
who may suffer incredibly from the cruel prudery ordained
by Mrs. Grundy, the only old woman to whom the word
“hag” should be applied. We must remove the reproach<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_140" id="p_140">[140]</a></span>
of Herbert Spencer, made nearly fifty years ago in words
which may well be quoted:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The greatest defect in our programmes of education is entirely
overlooked. While much is being done in the detailed improvement
of our systems in respect both of matter and manner, the
most pressing desideratum, to prepare the young for the duties of
life, is tacitly admitted to be the end which parents and schoolmasters
should have in view; and happily, the value of the things
taught, and the goodness of the methods followed in teaching
them, are now ostensibly judged by their fitness to this end. The
propriety of substituting for an exclusively classical training, a
training in which the modern languages shall have a share, is
argued on this ground. The necessity of increasing the amount
of science is urged for like reasons. But though some care is
taken to fit youth of both sexes for society and citizenship, no care
whatever is taken to fit them for the position of parents. While it
is seen that for the purpose of gaining a livelihood, an elaborate
preparation is needed, it appears to be thought that for the
bringing up of children, no preparation whatever is needed.
While many years are spent by a boy in gaining knowledge
of which the chief value is that it constitutes ‘the education of
a gentleman’; and while many years are spent by a girl in those
decorative acquirements which fit her for evening parties; not an
hour is spent by either in preparation for that gravest of all
responsibilities&mdash;the management of a family. Is it that this
responsibility is but a remote contingency? On the contrary, it
is sure to devolve on nine out of ten. Is it that the discharge
of it is easy? Certainly not; of all functions which the adult has
to fulfil, this is the most difficult. Is it that each may be trusted
by self-instruction to fit himself, or herself, for the office of parent?
No; not only is the need for such self-instruction unrecognised,
but the complexity of the subject renders it the one of all others
in which self-instruction is least likely to succeed.”</p></div>

<p><em class="psection">The lines of eugenic education.</em>&mdash;The teaching of the
main facts of heredity must come first in order to the
end of eugenic education. The vegetable world is at our
service in this regard, the products of horticulture with
their beauty and grace and novelty are illustrations one<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_141" id="p_141">[141]</a></span>
and all of what heredity means and what the due choice
of parents will effect. There need be no personal allusions
at this stage; the thing can be presented in an impersonal
biological setting. And as heredity produces these
wonderful results in plants, so also does it in the animal
world. Numberless domestic forms are at our service.
You take your children and your dog to the Zoological
gardens, and show the resemblance between wolf and
dog. What easier, then, than to point out that by
consistent choosing for many generations of the least
ferocious wolves, you may make a domesticated race?<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>The mind of any child that has fortunately escaped
“education” will make the transition for itself from sub-human
races to mankind, and instances will occur, say,
where extreme short-sightedness or deafness appears in
children whose parents were similarly afflicted, and were
perhaps closely related. At yet a later age a boy or girl
may learn the doom which often falls upon the children of
drunkards.</p>

<p>And then may it not be possible, when a little boy asks
what he is to be when he grows up, to suggest that the
highest profession to which he can be called, for which
he may strive to make himself worthy, is fatherhood?
And when the racial instinct awakes, would it be wrong,
improper, indecent, to teach that it has a purpose, that
no attribute of mind or body has a higher purpose, that
this is holy ground? Or is it better that by silence, both
as to the fact and as to its meaning, we should make it
unmentionable, indecent, dishonourable? The Bible is
used now-a-days as an instrument of political immorality,
but if and when it should be employed for the function
of other great literature, there is a passage sufficiently
relevant to our present argument.<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p_142" id="p_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>Perhaps we are wrong in regarding and treating the
racial instinct as if it were animal and low, a thing as far
as possible to be ignored, repressed, treated with silent
contempt in education and elsewhere. We may be
wrong in practice because the method is not successful,
because the development of this instinct is inevitable
and little short of imperious in every normal child if
that child is ever to become a man or a woman, and
because our silence does not involve the silence of less
responsible persons who are less likely even than we
ourselves to teach the young enquirer that this thing
exists for parenthood, and is therefore holy and to be
treated as such.</p>

<p>Perhaps we are wrong in principle also, since that which
exists for parenthood, and without which the continuance
and future terrestrial hope of mankind is impossible,
cannot be animal and low, unless human life, even at its
best attained or attainable, be animal and low. Our
business rather is to treat this great fact in a spirit
worthy of the purpose for which it exists; and therefore,
as part of that process of education by which we desire
to make the young into reasonable, moral and fully
human beings, to teach explicitly, without unworthy
shame, that this thing exists for the highest of purposes
that nothing which the future holds for boy or girl can
conceivably be higher or happier than worthy parenthood,
however commonplace that may appear to common
eyes, and that accordingly this instinct is to be guarded,
treated, used, honoured as for parenthood, a fact which
immediately raises it from the egoistic to the altruistic
plane. We have to learn and to teach that worthy
parenthood is the highest end which education can
achieve&mdash;highest alike on the ground of its services to
the individual and its services to the future, and the
relation of the racial instinct to parenthood being what<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_143" id="p_143">[143]</a></span>
it is, we have to look upon it in that light, at once austere
and splendid.</p>

<p>In the teaching of girls, only a false and disastrous
prudery offers any great obstacle. The idea of motherhood
is essentially natural to the normal girl. It is the
eugenic education of boys that is more difficult, and the
possibility of which will be questioned in some quarters,
especially by those who regard the type of boy evolved
in semi-monastic institutions, devoid of feminine influence,
as a normal and unchangeable being. Co-educationists,
however, are teaching us to revise that
opinion, and will yet demonstrate, perhaps, that the
inculcation of the idea of fatherhood is not so impossible
nor so alien to the boy nature as some would suppose.
If such a duty devolved upon the present writer, he would
feel inclined, perhaps, to present his teaching in terms
of patriotism. He would urge that “there is no wealth
but life”; that nations are made not of provinces nor
property but of people; that modern biology is teaching
historians to explain such phenomena as the fall of Rome
in terms of the quality of the national life; that therefore,
individuals being mortal, parenthood necessarily
takes its place as the supreme factor of national destiny;
that the true patriotism must therefore concern itself
with the conditions and the quality of parenthood&mdash;much
less with its quantity; that the patriotism which ignores
these truths is ignorant and must be disastrous; that we
must turn our attention therefore from flag waving to
questions of individual conduct; that if alcohol and
syphilis, for instance, can be demonstrated to be what
I would call racial poisons, the young patriot must make
himself aware of their relation to parenthood, and must
act upon his knowledge of that relation. It can thus be
demonstrated that righteousness exalteth a nation not
only in the spiritual but also in the most concrete sense.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p_144" id="p_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>To this we shall come. We may even recognise eugenic
education as the most urgent need of the day, as the
most radical and rational, perhaps even the most hopeful,
of the methods by which the cleansing of the city, and
much more, is to be achieved. We must create a eugenic
aspect for the moral sense. We can associate this alike with
individual and civic duty, and with those very ideals to
which, as we all know, the young most readily respond.
Thus I believe it shall be said of us in the after time that
we have raised up the foundations of many generations.</p>

<p>And so, finally, the unselfish significance of marriage
might conceivably be taught, alike to boys and girls, and
especially in the case of undoubtedly good stocks might
we inculcate, as Mr. Galton has pointed out, a rational
pride in ancestry&mdash;that is to say, a rational pride in the
quality of the germ-plasm which has been entrusted to
us. And so may be cultivated a eugenic aspect of the
moral sense&mdash;which is immeasurably more plastic than
any but the student of moral ideas knows&mdash;and, thus
endowed, the young man or woman will be prepared for
the possibility of marriage. It is perfectly conceivable
that in days to come the argument&mdash;in any case false&mdash;that
affection never brooks control, may become wholly
irrelevant, when there arises a generation in whose
members there has been cultivated or created the eugenic
sense. It is conceivable that, just as to-day the mere
possibility of falling in love is arrested by any of a thousand
trivial considerations, so misplaced affection may be
incapable of arising because its possible object affronts
the educated eugenic sense. The natural basis for such
education already exists. But the natural eugenic sense
still works mainly on the physical plane, and although
we owe to it the maintenance of our present modest
standard of physical beauty, we aim at higher ideals&mdash;and
will one day thus attain them.</p>

<small>THE SUPREMACY OF MOTHERHOOD</small></h3>

<div class="chapterblock">

<p>“The dregs of the human species&mdash;the blind, the deaf mute, the
degenerate, the imbecile, the epileptic&mdash;are better protected than
pregnant women.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bouchacourt.</span></p>

<p>“I hold that the two crowning and most accursed sins of the
society of this present day are the carelessness with which it
regards the betrayal of women, and the brutality with which
it suffers the neglect of children.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ruskin.</span></p></div>


<p>A chapter must be included here concerning a question
which can never safely be ignored in any consideration
of race-culture, but the importance of which, as I think
I see it, is recognised by no one who has concerned himself
at all with this subject, from Mr. Francis Galton himself
downwards. We must all be agreed, Mr. Galton declares,
as to the propriety of breeding, if it be possible, for health,
energy and ability, whatever else may be doubtful. To
this I would add that, whether we are agreed or not, we
must breed for motherhood, and that, even if we do not,
we shall have to reckon with it. The general eugenic
position, I fancy, is that the requirements which we
should make of both sexes, the mothers of the future as
well as the fathers, are essentially identical: but it seems
to me that we have not yet reckoned with the vast importance
of motherhood as a factor in the evolution of all
the higher species of animals, and its absolute supremacy,
inevitable and persistent whether recognised or ignored,
in the case of man. Any system of eugenics or race-culture,
any system of government, any proposal for
social reform&mdash;as, for instance, the reduction of infant<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_146" id="p_146">[146]</a></span>
mortality&mdash;which fails to reckon with motherhood or
falls short of adequately appraising it, is foredoomed to
failure and will continue to fail so long as the basal facts
of human nature and the development of the human
individual retain even approximately their present
character. Whatever proposals for eugenics or race-culture
be made or carried out, the fact will remain that
the race is made up of mortal individuals; that every
one of these begins its visible life as a helpless baby, and
that the system which does not permit the babies to
survive, <i>they</i> will not permit to survive.</p>

<p>This is a general and universal proposition, admitting
of no exceptions, past, present or to come. It
applies equally to conscious systems of race-culture,
to forms of marriage, to forms of government, to any
other social institution or practice or character that
can be named or conceived. Upon every one of
these the babies pronounce a judgment from which
there is no appeal. The baby may be a potential Newton,
Shakespeare, Beethoven or Buddha, but it is at its birth
the most helpless thing alive, the potentialities of which
avail it not one whit. It is in more need of care, immediate
and continuous, than a baby microbe or a baby
cat, whatever the unpublished glories of which its brain
contains the promise; and in the total absence of any
apparatus, mechanical, legal, or scientific, which can
provide the mother's breast and the mother's love,
individual motherhood, in its exquisitely complementary
aspects, physical and psychical, will remain the dominant
factor of history so long as the final judgments upon
every present and the final determinations for every
future lie in the hands of helpless babyhood&mdash;which will
be the case so long as man is mortal. When, if ever,
science, having previously conquered disease, identifies
the causes of natural death and removes them, then<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_147" id="p_147">[147]</a></span>
motherhood and babyhood may be thrown upon the
rubbish heap; but until that hour they are enthroned
by decree of Nature, and can be dethroned only at the
cost of Her certain and annihilative vengeance.</p>

<p>It is the master paradox that at his first appearance
the lord of the earth should be the most helpless of living
things. Consider a new-born baby. “Unable to stand,
much less to wander in search of food; very nearly deaf;
all but blind; well-nigh indiscriminating as to the nature
of what is presented to its mouth; utterly unable to keep
itself clean, yet highly susceptible to the effects of dirt;
able to indicate its needs only by alternately turning its
head, open-mouthed, from side to side and then crying;
possessed of an almost ludicrously hypersensitive interior;
unable to fast for more than two or three hours, yet
having the most precise and complicated dietetic requirements;
needing the most carefully maintained warmth;
easily injured by draughts; the prey of bacteria (which
take up a permanent abode in its alimentary canal by
the eleventh day)&mdash;where is to be found a more complete
picture of helpless dependence?”<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> How comes it that this
creature is to be lord of the earth, and a member of the only
species which succeeds in continually multiplying itself?</p>

<p><em class="psection">Motherhood and intelligence.</em>&mdash;We have maintained
that the vital character which is of supreme survival-value
for man is his intelligence, and this, as we know,
is his unique possession. It is very largely for intelligence,
therefore, that race-culture or eugenics proposes, if
possible, to work. But if there be certain conditions
which must be complied with before intelligence can
possibly be evolved, eugenics will come to disaster should
it ignore them. These conditions do exist, and have
hitherto been entirely ignored by all students of this
question. Let certain great facts be observed.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p_148" id="p_148">[148]</a></span></p>
<p>Why is the human baby the most helpless of all
creatures? Since it is to become the most capable, should
it not, even in its infant state, show signs of its coming
superiority? What is the meaning of this paradox?</p>

<p>The answer is that, so far as physical weapons of offence
and defence are concerned, these have disappeared because
intelligence makes them superfluous or even burdensome.
But the peculiar helplessness of the human infant depends
not upon its nakedness in the physical sense but upon its
lack of very nearly all instinctive capacities. It is this
absence of effective instincts which distinguishes the baby
from the young of all other creatures. Why should its
endowment in this respect be so inferior?</p>

<p>It is because of the fact that, if instinct is to give rise to
intelligence, it must be plastic. A purely instinctive
creature reacts to certain sets of circumstances in certain
effortless, perfect and fixed ways. The reactions are the
whole of its psychical life. They need no education,
being as perfectly performed on the first occasion as on
the last, and in many instances being performed only once
in the whole history of the creature in question. But, on the
other hand, they are almost incapable of education, and
even in the cases where they lack absolute perfection at
first, they only require the merest modicum of opportunity
in order to acquire it. Perfect within their limits, they are
yet most definitely limited. They never achieve the new,
they are utterly at fault in novel circumstances, and they
are wholly incapable of creating circumstances.</p>

<p>A creature cannot be at once purely instinctive and
intelligent. An instinctive action is simply a compound
reflex action, a highly adapted automatism: now automatism
and intelligence are necessarily inversely proportional.
It is possible for an intelligent creature to acquire
automatisms, which are popularly described as instinctive.
They are not instincts, however, but the acquired equivalents<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_149" id="p_149">[149]</a></span>
of instincts: “secondary automatisms.” If they
are used to replace intelligence, the individual, in so far,
sinks from the human to the sub-human level. Their
proper function is to leave the intelligence free for higher
purposes more worthy of it than, say, the act of dressing
oneself.</p>

<p>In order that an intelligent creature should be evolved
it was necessary that instinct should become plastic.
Intelligence could not be superposed upon a complete and
final instinctive equipment. You cannot determine your
own acts if they are already determined for you by your
nervous organisation. The incomparable superiority of
intelligence depends upon its limitless and creative
character, in virtue of which, as Disraeli puts it, “men are
not the creatures of circumstances: circumstances are
the creatures of men.” But whilst intelligence can learn
everything, it has everything to learn, and the most nearly
intelligent creature whom the earth affords thus begins
his independent life almost wholly bereft of all the instruments
which have served the lower creatures so well,
whilst, on the other hand, he is provided with an utterly
undeveloped, and indeed, at that time non-existent,
weapon which, even if it did exist, he could not use.
Hence the unique helplessness of the human baby: one
of the most wonderful and little appreciated facts in the
whole of nature&mdash;effectively hidden from the glass eyes of
the kind of man who calls a baby a “brat,” but, to eyes that
can see, not only the master paradox from the philosophical
point of view but also a fact of the utmost moment
from the practical point of view.</p>

<p><em class="psection">The evolution of motherhood.</em>&mdash;It directly follows that
motherhood is supremely important in the case of man.
It is the historical fact that its importance in the history
of the animal world has been steadily increasing throughout
æonian time. The most successful and ancient<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_150" id="p_150">[150]</a></span>
societies we know, those of the social insects, which antedate
by incalculable ages even the first vertebrates, could
not survive for a single generation without the motherhood
or foster-motherhood to which the worker females
sacrifice their lives and their own chances of physical
maternity.</p>

<p>The development of maternal care may be steadily
traced throughout the vertebrate series&mdash;<i>pari passu</i> with
the evolution of sexual relations towards the ideal of
monogamy, which is ideal just because of its incomparable
services to motherhood. But whilst motherhood is
of the utmost service for lower creatures, tending always
to lessen infant mortality&mdash;if it may be so called&mdash;and to
increase the proportion of life to death and birth, it is of
supreme service in the case of man because of the absolute
dependence upon it of intelligence, the solitary but unexampled
weapon with which he has won the earth. Hence
in breeding for intelligence we cannot afford to ignore that
upon which intelligence depends. Even if we could produce
genius at will, we should find our young geniuses just
as dependent upon motherhood as the common run of
mankind. Newton himself was a seven months' baby, and
the potentialities of gravitation and the calculus and the
laws of motion in his brain could not save him: motherhood
could and did.</p>

<p>Even our least biological reformers must admit that
purely physical motherhood, up to the point of birth, can
scarcely be omitted in any schemes for social reform or
race-culture. Some of them will even admit that purely
physical motherhood, so far as the mother's breasts are
concerned, cannot wisely be dispensed with. The psychical
aspects of motherhood, however, many of these writers&mdash;I
do not call them thinkers&mdash;ignore. In relation to infant
mortality&mdash;which is the most obvious symptom of causes
productive of vast and widespread physical deterioration<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_151" id="p_151">[151]</a></span>
amongst the survivors, and which must be abolished before
any really effective race-culture is possible&mdash;it is worth
noting that motherhood cannot safely be superseded. I
do not believe in the <i>crèche</i> or the municipal milk depôt
except as stop-gaps, or as object-lessons for those who
imagine that the slaughtered babies are not slaughtered
but die of inherent defect, and that therefore infant
mortality is a beneficent process. In working for the reduction
of this evil we must work through and by motherhood.
In some future age, boasting the elements of sanity, our
girls will be instructed in these matters. At present the
most important profession in the world is almost entirely
carried on by unskilled labour, and until this state of
things is put an end to, it is almost idle to talk of race-culture
at all. But under our present system of education,
false and rotten as it is in principles and details alike,
it is necessary for us to send visitors to the homes of the
classes which, in effect, supply almost the whole of the
future population of the country, and to establish
schools for mothers on every hand.</p>

<p><em class="psection">Psychical motherhood.</em>&mdash;I confess myself opposed to
the principle of bribing a woman to become a
mother, whether overtly or covertly, whether in the
guise of State-aid or in the form of eugenic premiums
for maternity. It may sound very well to offer a bonus
for the production of babies by mothers whom the
State or any eugenic power considers fit and worthy. But
though the bonus may help motherhood in its physical
aspects, the importance of which no one questions, I do
not see what service it renders to motherhood in its
psychical aspects&mdash;which are at least equally important.
What is the outlook for the baby when the bonus is spent?
In fact, with all deference to Mr. Galton, and with such
deference as may be due to the literary triflers who have
discussed this matter, I am inclined to think that a<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_152" id="p_152">[152]</a></span>
cardinal requisite for a mother is love of children. Ignorant
this may be, and indeed at first always is, but if it is
there it can be instructed. The woman who does not
think the possession of a baby a sufficient prize is no fit
object, I should say, for any other kind of bribe or lure.
The woman who “would rather have a spare bedroom
than a baby” is the woman whom I do not want to have
a baby. Thus I look with suspicion on any proposals
which assume that the psychical elements of motherhood
are of little moment in eugenics. I see no sign or prospect
that they can be dispensed with, and I think eugenics is
going to work on wrong lines if it proposes to ignore them.
Even if you turn out Nature with a fork she will yet
return&mdash;<i>tamen usque recurret</i>.</p>

<p>In this question we should be able to derive great
assistance from biography. Real guidance, I believe, is
obtained from this source, but only a pitiable fraction of
that which should be obtained. Scientific biography
is yet to seek, and it is the ironical fact that when Herbert
Spencer, in his <i>Autobiography</i>, devoted a large amount
of space to the discussion of <i>both</i> his parents and their
relatives, the literary critics were bored to death. Nevertheless,
we cannot know too much about the ancestry, on
both sides, and the early environment, of great men. At
present it is always tacitly assumed that a great man is
the son of his father alone. The biographer would probably
admit, if pressed, that doubtless some woman or
other was involved in the matter, and that her name was
so and so&mdash;if any one thinks it worth mentioning. On
the score of heredity alone, however, we derive, men and
women alike, with absolute equality from both parents;
and we cannot know too much about the mothers of men
of genius. Such knowledge would often avail us materially
in cases where the paternal ancestry offers little
explanation of the child's destiny.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p_153" id="p_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>We do owe, however, to great men themselves many
warm and unqualified tributes to their mothers, not on
the score of heredity, but on the score of the psychical
aspects of motherhood. This, indeed, is one of the great
lessons of biography which some eugenists have forgotten.
It is all very well to breed for intelligence, but intelligence
needs nurture and guidance, and that need is the more
urgent, the more powerful and original the intelligence in
question. The physical functions of motherhood from the
moment of birth onwards can be effected, no doubt, though
at very great cost, by means of incubators and milk laboratories,
and so forth. But there is no counterfeiting or
replacing the psychical component of complete maternity,
and a generation of the highest intelligence borne by
unmaternal women would probably succeed only in
writing the blackest and maddest page in history.</p>

<p><em class="psection">The eugenic demand for love.</em>&mdash;Mr. Galton desires
that we breed for physique, ability, and energy. But
we also need more love, and we must breed for that.
Nothing is easier or more inevitable once we make
human parenthood conscious and deliberate. When
children are born only to those who love children, and
who will tend to transmit their high measure of that
parental instinct from which all love is derived, we shall
bring to earth a heaven compared with which the
theologian's is but a fool's paradise.</p>

<p>The first requisite, then, for the mothers of the future,
the elements of physical health being assumed, is that
they should be motherly. They may or may not, in
addition, be worthy of such exquisite titles as “the female
Shakespeare of America,” but they must have motherliness
to begin with. For this indispensable thing there is
no substitute. It must certainly be granted, and the fact
should not be ignored, that the hidden spring of motherliness
in a girl may be revealed only by actual maternity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_154" id="p_154">[154]</a></span>
and the frivolous damsel who used to think babies “silly
squalling things” may be mightily transformed when the
silly squalling thing is her own&mdash;and the Fifth Symphony
sound and fury signifying nothing compared with its
slightest whimper. I will grant even that the maternal
instinct is so deeply rooted and universal that its
absence must be regarded as either a rare abnormality
or else as the product of the grossest mal-education
in the wide sense. But the reader will not blame me
for insisting at such length upon what, as he would
think, no one could deny, when he discovers that these
salient truths are denied, and that in what should be
the sacred name of eugenics, they are openly flouted and
defied.</p>

<p>Before we go on to consider these perversions of a great
idea, it may briefly be observed that, though fatherhood
is historically a mushroom growth compared with motherhood,
and though its importance is vastly less, yet as a
complementary principle, aiding and abetting motherhood,
and making for its most perfect expression, fatherhood
played a great part in animal evolution, in the right
line of progress, ages before man appeared upon the earth
at all, and that its work is not yet done. To this subject
we must return. Meanwhile it is well to note the dangers
with which eugenics is at present threatened in the form
of certain proposals which, if for a time they became
popular&mdash;and they have elements making for popularity&mdash;would
inevitably throw the gravest discredit upon the
whole subject.</p>

<p><em class="psection">Eugenics and the family.</em>&mdash;Certain remarkable
tendencies invoking the name of eugenics are now to be
observed in Germany. These have considerable funds,
much enthusiasm, journalistic support, and even a large
measure of assistance in academic circles. In pursuance
of the idea of eugenics there is a movement the nature of<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_155" id="p_155">[155]</a></span>
which is indicated by the following quotation from a
private letter:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I wonder if your attention was drawn to the German projects
of the reform of the Family. They all aim at improving the
German race and rendering decisive its superiority over all others.
The means seem to be too revolutionary. The more modern wish
the establishment of the matriarchal family (<i>ein nach Mutterrecht</i>),
the more logical require universal polygamy and polyandry, an
individualisation of Society. Others hope to increase the production
of German geniuses by the ‘hellenic friendship.’[!] The
three movements are strongly organised, command large pecuniary
means, a phalanx of original and prolific writers, and enthusiastic
devotion to their cause. More even than the support of Courts
and aristocracy is, in my eyes, that of the Universities. It is there
that the destinies of Germany have always been shaped, and if
they are determined to reform the Family in that way, it will be
done.... The Herren Professoren are terribly in earnest, yet
they say things which even to the least prejudiced minds appear
ridiculous and even vulgar. Still, their projects have some
relation to Eugenics, and to Sociology in general.”</p></div>

<p>This sufficiently indicates the dangers run by the eugenic
principle at the hands of those who see in it an instrument
of protest and rebellion against established things. We
dare not repudiate the sacred principles of protest and
rebellion, which have been the conditions of all progress,
but believing in motherhood as we must, believing it to be
authorised by nature herself and not by any human conventions,
we must deplore any tendencies such as the two
last cited. For us in this country, however, a more immediate
interest attaches to the views of a much admired
and discussed writer who claims to be a social philosopher
of the first order, and whose claims must now be examined.</p>

<p>The opinions of Mr. Bernard Shaw on the question of
eugenics may be quoted from his contribution to the
subject published in <i>Sociological Papers</i> 1904, pp. 74, 75,
in discussion of Mr. Galton's great paper. Mr. Shaw
begins by saying: <span class="pagenum"><a name="p_156" id="p_156">[156]</a></span>“I agree with the paper and go so far
as to say that there is now no reasonable excuse for refusing
to face the fact that nothing but a eugenic religion can
save our civilisation from the fate that has overtaken all
previous civilisations.” And further:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I am afraid we must make up our minds either to face a
considerable shock to vulgar opinion in this matter or to let
eugenics alone.... What we must fight for is freedom to breed
the race without being hampered by the mass of irrelevant conditions
implied in the institution of marriage. If our morality is
attacked, we can carry the war into the enemy's country by
reminding the public that the real objection to breeding by
marriage is that marriage places no restraint on debauchery, so
long as it is monogamic.... What we need is freedom for
people who have never seen each other before and never intend to
see one another again, to produce children under certain definite
public conditions, without loss of honour.”</p></div>

<p>The conception of individual fatherhood here stated
involves a deliberate reversion to the order of the beast:
it excludes individual fatherhood from any function in
aiding motherhood or in serving the future. It involves,
of course, the total abolition of the family. It denies
and flouts the very best elements in human nature. It
assumes that the best women will find motherhood worth
while without the interest and sympathy and help and protection
of the father. It does not, however, condemn or
exclude the psychical functions of motherhood, since so far
as this quotation goes it might be assumed that the mother
would be permitted to live with her own child. On this
point, however, Mr. Shaw offered us further guidance in his
controversy with myself in the <i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>, in
December, 1907. One or two of his <i>dicta</i> must here be
quoted&mdash;they followed upon my remark, “Anything less
like a mother than the State I find it hard to imagine”:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p_157" id="p_157">[157]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot">

<p>“When the State left the children to the mothers, they got
no schooling; they were sent out to work under inhuman conditions,
under-ground and over-ground for atrociously long hours,
as soon as they were able to walk; they died of typhus fever
in heaps; they grew up to be as wicked to their own children as
their parents had been to them. State socialism rescued them
from the worst of that, and means to rescue them from all of it. I
now publicly challenge Dr. Saleeby to propose, if he dares, to
withdraw the hand of the State and abandon the children to
their mothers as they fall.... All I need say is that before Dr.
Saleeby can persuade me to sacrifice the future of human society
to his maternalism, he will have to tackle me with harder weapons
than the indignant enthusiasm of a young man's mother worship.”</p></div>

<p>Mr. Shaw's teaching constitutes a brutal and deliberate
libel upon the highest aspects of womanhood. For his own
purposes he attributes to the mothers all the abominations
which, as every one knows, have lain and in some measure
still lie, at the door of the State. The man who has this
opinion of motherhood is complacently ignorant of the
elements of the subject. His charge is denied by every one
who has worked as doctor or nurse or visitor or missionary
amongst the poorer classes, and knows that the mothers
there met are of the very salt of the earth.</p>

<p>It is well to state plainly here that these utterly irresponsible
<i>dicta</i> have absolutely no relation or resemblance
whatever to the opinions or proposals of Mr. Francis Galton
himself, who desires to effect race-culture through marriage,
and whose whole propaganda is based upon this assumption.
This we shall afterwards see. Meanwhile we may
note Mr. Galton's own words: “The aim of eugenics is to
bring as many influences as can be reasonably employed,
to cause the useful classes in the community to contribute
more than their proportion to the next generation.” Mr.
Galton would be the first to assert that influences designed
to supersede motherhood and to abolish everything but
the physical aspect of fatherhood, would not be reasonable,
but insane in the highest degree.</p>

<p>The ideal of race-culture without fatherhood or motherhood,
except in the mere physiological sense, constitutes<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_158" id="p_158">[158]</a></span>
a denial of the greatest facts in evolution, as we have seen.
It ignores everything that is known and daily witnessed
regarding the development of the individual, and the
formation of character, without which intelligence is a
curse. There is not the slightest fear that any such reversion
to the order of the beast is possible, absolutely forbidden
as it is by the laws of human nature. There is,
however, reasonable ground for apprehension, especially
when the recent developments in Germany are remembered,
that the public may obtain its notions of eugenics
in a highly-garbled form.<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>It must be asserted as fervently and plainly as possible
that, if the idea of race-culture is even in the smallest
degree to be realised, it must work through motherhood
and fatherhood not less in their psychical than in their
physical aspects. It is time to have done with the gross
delusions of Nietzsche regarding the nature and course of
organic evolution. Morality is not an invention of man
but man the child of morality, and it is not by the
abolition of motherhood, in which morality originated,
nor of fatherhood, its first ally, that the super-man is
to be evolved: but by the attainment of those lofty
conceptions of the function, the responsibility and the
privilege of parenthood which it is the first business of
eugenics to inculcate.</p>

<p>As for marriage, invaluable though at its best it be for
the completion and ennoblement of the individual life,
its great function for society and for the race is in relation
to childhood. Thus considered, the dictum of Professor
Westermarck may be understood, that children are not<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_159" id="p_159">[159]</a></span>
the result of marriage but marriage the result of children.
This, in other words, is to say that marriage has become
evolved and established as a social institution because of
its services to race-culture. It is, in short, the supreme
eugenic institution. This great subject must next occupy
our attention.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p_160" id="p_160">[160]</a></span></p>




<h3><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</a><br />
<small>MARRIAGE AND MATERNALISM</small></h3>


<p>Our present concern is the relation of marriage to race-culture,
and for this purpose we must investigate an
epoch ages before the institution of human marriage,
ages before mankind itself. We must first remind
ourselves of what may be called the trend of
progress from the first in respect of that reproduction
upon which all species depend, all living individuals
being mortal.</p>

<p>At first, in the effort for survival and increase, life tried
the quantitative method. If we take the present day
bacteria as representatives of the primitive method, we
see that not quality nor individuality but quantity and
numbers are the means by which, in their case, life seeks
to establish itself more abundantly. We express our own
birth-rate in its proportion per year to one thousand
living: but twenty thousand bacteria injected into a
rabbit have been found to multiply into twelve thousand
million in one day. “One bacterium has been actually
observed to rear a small family of eighty thousand within
a period of twenty-four hours.” “The cholera bacillus
can duplicate every twenty minutes, and might thus in
one day become 5,000,000,000,000,000,000,000, with the
weight, according to the calculations of Cohn, of about
7,366 tons. In a few days, at this rate, there would be
a mass of bacteria as big as the moon, huge enough to
fill the whole ocean.”</p>

<p>If now we trace the history of life up to man, we find
in him&mdash;as we have seen&mdash;the lowest birth-rate of any<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_161" id="p_161">[161]</a></span>
animal and the longest ante-natal period in proportion to
his body weight, the longest period of maternal feeding,
and by far the lowest infant mortality and general death-rate.
A chief fact of progress has been, in a word, the
supersession of the quantitative by the qualitative
criterion of survival-value. Immeasurably vast vital
economy and efficiency have thus been effected. The
tendency of progress, in short&mdash;a tendency coincident
with the evolution of ever higher and higher species&mdash;is to
pass from the horrible Gargantuan wastefulness of the
older methods towards the evident but yet lamentably
unrealised ideal&mdash;that every child born shall reach
maturity. This great historical tendency, which will
ultimately involve the restriction of parenthood to the fit,
fine and relatively few, has occurred under the impartial
rule of natural selection simply and solely because it has
endowed with survival-value the successive species in
which it has been demonstrated.</p>

<p><em class="psection">The rise of parenthood.</em>&mdash;Consistently with this fact
and with the argument of the previous chapter is the
tendency towards the lengthening of infancy, a very
characteristic condition of the evolution of the higher
forms of life. This lengthening and accentuation of
infancy makes for variety of development, and, as we have
seen, is supremely instanced in man, where it depends
upon, and makes possible, the transmutation of fixed
instincts into the plastic thing we call intelligence. Thus,
to quote the words of Dr. Parsons,<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> “we find that as
infancy is prolonged in the progress of species, the care
given to offspring by parents is increased. It extends
over a longer period and it is directed more and more
towards the total welfare of offspring. The need of a
potentially many-sided and enduring kind of parental
care is filled through the social group we call the family.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p_162" id="p_162">[162]</a></span></p>
<p>Apart from those immensely significant creatures, the
social insects, we find well-marked though primitive signs
of motherhood amongst the fishes, and in a few cases,
such as the stickleback, the beginnings of fatherhood.
But it is not until we reach the mammals, and especially
the monkeys and apes, that we find a great development
of motherhood, far more prolonged and far more important
than the more frequently extolled parental care
found amongst the birds.</p>

<p>Very interesting, however, in the case of the fishes is
the fact observed by Sutherland that “as soon as the
slightest trace of parental care is discovered the chance
of survival is increased and the birth-rate is lowered.”
As a general summary these words of Dr. Parsons will
serve:&mdash;“Diminution of offspring is a threefold gain to
a species. (1) It lessens the vital drain upon the parent.
(2) It enables the size and capacity of the limited number
of offspring to be increased. (3) In the case of the higher
developments of parental care after birth, it concentrates
the advantage of that care upon a few instead of scattering
it, and thereby weakening its influence, upon many.”</p>

<p>Now how are these facts connected with that relation
between the parents which we call marriage, temporary
or permanent, foreshadowed or perfected?</p>

<p><i>It may be submitted that the racial function or survival-value
of marriage in all its forms, low or high, animal or
human, consists in its services to the principle of motherhood,
these services depending upon the help and strength which
are afforded to motherhood by fatherhood.</i></p>

<p><em class="psection">Animal marriage.</em>&mdash;Let us now look very briefly at the
facts of animal marriage from this point of view. The
phrase, animal marriage, may possibly offend the reader,
but is there any reason to be offended at the suggestion
that the principle of marriage actually has a warrant
older even than mankind? It has lately been pointed<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_163" id="p_163">[163]</a></span>
out by a distinguished naturalist, Mr. Ernest Thompson
Seton, that animals, like men, have long been groping, so
to say, for an ideal form of marriage. We now know, as
will be shown, that, contrary to popular opinion, promiscuity
does not prevail amongst the lowest races of
men. Equally false is the popular notion that promiscuity
prevails amongst most of the lower animals.
Promiscuity, it is true, does occur, but so also does strict
monogamy, “and promiscuous animals, such as rabbits
and voles, while high in the scale of fecundity, are low
in the scale of general development.” Says Mr. Seton:
“It is commonly remarked that while the Mosaic law
did not expressly forbid polygamy, it surrounded marriage
with so many restrictions that by living up to the spirit
of them the Hebrew ultimately was forced into pure
monogamy. It is extremely interesting to note that the
animals, in their blind groping for an ideal form of union,
have gone through the same stages, and have arrived at
exactly the same conclusion. Monogamy is their best
solution of the marriage question, and is the rule among
all the higher and most successful animals.”</p>

<p>The moose, Mr. Seton tells us, has several wives in one
season but only one at a time. The hawks practise monogamy
lasting for one season, “the male staying with the
family, and sharing the care of the young till they are
well-grown.” The wolves consort for life, but the death of
one leaves the other free to mate again. There is a fourth
method “in which they pair for life, and, in case of death,
the survivor remains disconsolate and alone to the end.
This seems absurd. It is the way of the geese.” The point
especially to be insisted upon as regards animal marriage
is its evident service to their race-culture, in accordance
with the principle here laid down that <i>marriage is of
value because it supports motherhood by fatherhood</i>, and that
its different forms are of value in proportion as they do<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_164" id="p_164">[164]</a></span>
so more or less effectively. We may note also, as a corollary
to this, that marriage must be more important in
proportion as the young of a species are helpless and in
proportion as their helplessness is long continued. The
importance of marriage for man, therefore, must necessarily
be higher than for any of the lower animals.</p>

<p><em class="psection">Human marriage.</em>&mdash;We must turn now to human
marriage, and the principle which we must remember is
that of survival-value. We are discussing a natural
phenomenon exhibited by living creatures. This is what
so few people realise when they speak of marriage. They
cannot disabuse themselves of the idea that it is a human
invention, and especially an ecclesiastical invention.
Thus, on the one hand, it is supported by persons who base
its claims on mystical or dogmatic grounds; whilst, on the
other hand, it is attacked by those who are opposed to
ecclesiasticism or religion of any kind, and attacked in the
name of science&mdash;in which, if the fact could only be recognised,
is found every possible warrant and sanction, and
indeed imperative demand, for this most precious of all
institutions. Here we must endeavour to look upon it as
an exceedingly ancient fact of life, vastly more ancient
than mankind; and in judging it and explaining it we must
apply Nature's universal criterion, which is that of its
survival-value or service to race-culture. Let us then
glance very briefly at the actual facts of human marriage&mdash;conceived
as an institution by which the survival-value
of fatherhood is added to that of motherhood.</p>

<p>The pioneer student of marriage from the standpoint
of science was Herbert Spencer, who with great labour
supported the conclusion that monogamy is the highest,
best and latest form of marriage. But in the absence of
the great mass of evidence which is now before us, Spencer
too readily assumed the truth of the popular notion that
promiscuity was the primitive state, and taught that<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_165" id="p_165">[165]</a></span>
human marriage has developed from this through polygamy
towards the ideal of monogamy. The work of
Professor Westermarck, however&mdash;Spencer's chief follower
in this path&mdash;has shown, and later writers have abundantly
confirmed it, that this primitive promiscuity never
existed. There is no nation or race or clan of man now
extant, however primitive or barbaric, that has not definite
marriage laws; there is no society on earth, however
rude, that does not punish the unfaithful wife. Furthermore,
polygamy, the only historical rival of monogamy,
is now known to have played a quite trivial part in history,
not merely compared with monogamy, but as compared
with that which it was supposed to have played. Even
in countries which we call polygamous to-day, polygamy
is the relatively rare exception and monogamy the rule.
On this most important question it is well, however, to
quote the words of Professor Westermarck himself:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The great majority of peoples are, as a rule, monogamous,
and the other forms of marriage are usually modified in a monogamous
direction.” “As to the history of the forms of human
marriage, two inferences regarding monogamy and polygyny may
be made with absolute certainty; monogamy, always the predominant
form of marriage, has been more prevalent at the
lowest stages of civilisation than at somewhat higher stages;
whilst, at a still higher stage, polygyny has again, to a great
extent, yielded to monogamy.” “We may thus take it for
granted that civilisation, up to a certain point, is favourable
to polygyny; but it is equally certain that in its highest forms
it leads to monogamy.” “But, though civilisation up to a certain
point is favourable to polygyny, <i>its higher forms invariably and
necessarily lead to monogamy</i>.”</p></div>

<p>It is the principle of survival-value that explains the
dominance of monogamy at all stages of human society&mdash;with
the single exception of continuously and wholly
militant societies, in which polygamy obtained in consequence
of the great numerical excess of women. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_166" id="p_166">[166]</a></span>
the fate of the children, in which everything is involved,
that has determined the history of human marriage.
Furthermore, we may see here one more illustration of the
truth that quality is ousting quantity in the course of
progress, and that a low birth-rate represents a more
advanced stage than a high birth-rate. The birth-rate
under polygamy is undoubtedly high, but polygamy does
not make for the survival and health of the children, and
the infant mortality is gigantic. As I have said elsewhere,
“the form of marriage which does not permit the babies
to survive, <i>they</i> do not permit to survive. There is the
beginning and the end of the whole matter in a nutshell.
It is not a question of the father's taste and fancy, but of
what he leaves above ground when the worms are eating
him below.... No system yet conceived can compare
for a moment with monogamy in respect of the one
criterion which time and death recognise, the fate of the
children.”</p>

<p>In a word, the wholly adequate and only possible
explanation of the historical fact of the dominance of
monogamy is its supreme survival-value. It has competed
with every other kind of sex relation and has been
selected by natural selection because of its supreme service
for race-culture&mdash;the most perfect conceivable addition
of fatherhood to motherhood.</p>

<p><em class="psection">Plato and motherhood.</em>&mdash;Thus eugenics must repudiate
not only the ideas of Mr. Shaw on this subject,
but the teaching of Plato, from whom Mr. Shaw's
ideas on this particular subject are apparently derived.
It is in the fifth book of his <i>Republic</i> that the pioneer
eugenist lays down his ideas for race-culture. He realised,
indeed, the importance, after birth, of the nurture of
children&mdash;“it is of considerable, nay, of the utmost importance
to the State, when this is rightly performed or otherwise;”
and he refers also to their nurture while very<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_167" id="p_167">[167]</a></span>
young, “in the period between their generation and their
education, which seems to be the most troublesome of all.”
His method involved a complete community of wives and
children amongst the guardians of the State, and on no
account were the parents to know their own children nor
the children their parents. The best were to be chosen
for parents, on the analogy of animal race-culture by man.
The children of inferior parents were to be killed. The
others were to be conveyed to the common nursery of the
city, but every precaution was to be taken that <i>no mother
should know her own child</i>. This practice was to be the
cardinal point of the Republic and “the cause of the
greatest good to the city.”</p>

<p>We see here, then, that the very first proposals for
race-culture involved the destruction of marriage and the
family, and a total denial of the value of the psychical
aspects of motherhood and fatherhood alike. Plato's
first critic, however, his own great pupil Aristotle, devoted
the best part of his work, the <i>Politics</i>, to showing that the
suggestions of Plato were not only wrong in themselves,
but would not secure his end. Aristotle showed, in the
words of Mr. Barker, that “the destruction of the family,
and the substitution in its place of one vast clan, would
lead but to the destruction of warm feelings, and the
substitution of a sentiment which is to them as water is
to wine.... So with the system of common marriage, as
opposed to monogamy. The one encourages at best a poor
and shadowy sentiment, while it denies to man the satisfaction
of natural instinct and the education of family life;
the other is natural and right, both because it is based on
those instincts, and because it satisfies the moral nature
of man, in giving him objects of permanent yet vivid
interest above and beyond himself.” The truth of this
matter is that the rest may reason and welcome&mdash;but we
fathers know.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p_168" id="p_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p><em class="psection">Marriage a eugenic instrument.</em>&mdash;It has definitely
to be stated, then, that the abolition of marriage
and the family is in no degree whatever a part of
the eugenic proposal. We desire to achieve race-culture
by and through marriage, on the lines which
indeed many lower races of men successfully practise at
the present day. We must make parenthood more
responsible, not less so. It will afterwards be shown that
the suggested incompatibility between marriage and the
family, on the one hand, and race-culture or eugenics on
the other, does not exist. It will be shown that we have
in marriage not only the greatest instrument of race-culture
that has yet been employed&mdash;half-consciously&mdash;by
man, but also an instrument supremely fitted, and
indeed without a rival, for the conscious, deliberate, and
scientific intentions of modern eugenists. The applicability
of marriage for this purpose will be shown by
reference to actual facts. Mr. Galton himself has shown
how effectively an educated public opinion can employ
marriage for the purposes of race-culture, its services to
which have indeed led to its evolution. It has furthermore
to be added that only the formation of public opinion can
ever lead to the ideal which we desire. This opinion already
exists in some degree as regards one or two transmissible
diseases, and, though without adequate scientific warrant,
as regards the marriage of first cousins. In these respects
it is not without some measure of effectiveness, and the
fact is of the utmost promise.</p>

<p>“Marriage,” said Goethe, “is the origin and the
summit of all civilisation.” Perhaps it would be more
accurate to say <i>the family</i> rather than <i>marriage</i>. The
childless marriage may be and often is a thing of the
utmost beauty and value to the individuals concerned,
but it is certainly not the origin of civilisation, and if
it be its summit it is also its grave. The eugenic<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_169" id="p_169">[169]</a></span>
support of marriage, therefore, depends upon a belief
in the family, and that form of marriage will commend
itself which provides the best form of family. From
the point of view of certain eugenists, polygamy would
be desirable in many cases, as extending the parental
opportunities of the man of fine physique or intellectual
distinction. The problem remains, however, as to the
nurture of the children so obtained, and historical study
returns us a very clear answer as to the relative merits
of the polygamous family and the monogamous family.
It is this last that pre-eminently justifies itself on the score
of its services to childhood and therefore to the race. Its
survival is a matter of absolute certainty, because of its
survival-value. Neither Plato nor Mr. Shaw, nor any kind
of collectivist legislation will permanently abolish it.</p>

<p><em class="psection">The principle of maternalism.</em>&mdash;The merits of monogamy
can be defined in terms of the principle which
I would venture to call maternalism&mdash;the principle of
the permanent and radical importance of motherhood
and whatever institutions afford it the greatest aid.</p>

<p>Maternalism would point, I think, to the supreme
paradox that the dominant creature of the earth is
born of woman, and born the most absolutely helpless
of all living creatures whatsoever, animal or vegetable;
it would note that this utter dependence upon others,
mother or foster-mother, is not only the most unqualified
known, but the longest maintained; it would observe
that of all the human beings now alive, all that have
lived, all that are to be, not one could survive its birth
for twenty-four hours but for motherhood; it would
note that only motherhood has rendered possible the
development of instinct into that intelligence which,
itself dependent upon motherhood for the possibility of its
development, has dependent upon it the fact that the
earth is now man's and the fulness thereof; and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_170" id="p_170">[170]</a></span>
the advocates of all the political -isms that can be named,
and the small proportion of them that can be defined,
it would apply its specific criterion: Do you regard
the safeguarding and the ennoblement of motherhood
as the proximate end of all political action, the end
through which the ultimate ends, the production and
recognition of human worth, can alone be attained;
do you realise that marriage is invaluable <i>because</i> it
makes for the enthronement of motherhood as nothing
else ever did or can; do you realise that, metaphors
about State maternity notwithstanding, the State has
neither womb nor breasts, these most reverend and
divine of all vital organs being the appanage of the
individual mother alone?</p>

<p>The maternalist principle being assumed, and the
value of monogamy on the ground that it supports
motherhood by fatherhood, the forthcoming discussion
as to the possibilities of race-culture will assume the
persistence of monogamy and will centre upon the
possibility of selecting or rejecting, for the purposes of
race-culture, those who are available for entrance into
the marriage state. The reader who has not studied social
anthropology&mdash;and this is true of nearly all the critics of
eugenics, very few of whom have studied anything&mdash;will
be astounded, I believe, to discover the practically
unlimited extent to which public opinion, whether or
not formulated as law, has always been capable of
controlling marriage, and therefore, race-culture.</p>


<p><em class="psection">Proposed definition of marriage.</em>&mdash;Recognising the
existence of subhuman marriage, we may be at a loss to
define marriage as distinguished from sex-relations in
general. It is that form of sex-relation which involves
or is adapted to <i>common parental care</i> of the offspring&mdash;the
support of motherhood by fatherhood.</p>

<p>N'abandonnons pas l'avenir de notre race à la fatalité

<p>“It is surprising how soon a want of care, or care wrongly
directed, leads to the degeneration of a domestic race; but except
in the case of man himself, hardly anyone is so ignorant as
to allow his worst animals to breed.</p>

<p>“With savages, the weak in body or mind are soon eliminated,
and those that survive commonly exhibit a vigorous state of
health. We civilised men, on the other hand, do our utmost to
check the process of elimination; we build asylums for the
imbecile, the maim and the sick; we institute poor laws; and our
medical men exert their utmost skill to save the life of everyone
to the last moment.... Thus the weak members of civilised
societies propagate their kind. No one who has attended to the
breeding of domestic animals will doubt that this must be highly
injurious to the race of man.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Darwin</span>, <i>The Descent of Man</i>, 1871.
Pt. i., chap. v.</p></div>


<p>Hitherto we have mainly concerned ourselves with
broad aspects of theory, endeavouring to prove that
conscious race-culture is a necessity for any civilisation
which is to endure, and to show how alone it can be
effected. But evidently for a great many of the practical
proposals that might be, and for not a few that have
been, based upon these views, public opinion is not
ripe. We may be thankful to believe that for some it
will never be ripe: it would be rotten first. Marriage,
for instance, we hold sacred and essential: we find intolerable
the idea of the human stud-farm; we are very
dubious as to the help of surgery; we are much more<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_172" id="p_172">[172]</a></span>
than dubious as to the lethal chamber. It is necessary
to be reasonable, and, in seeking the superman, to remain
at least human. Now if we are to achieve any immediate
success we must clearly divide our proposals, as the present
writer did some years ago, with Mr. Galton's approval, into
two classes: <i>positive eugenics</i> and <i>negative eugenics</i>. The
one would seek to encourage the parenthood of the
worthy, the other to discourage the parenthood of the
unworthy. Positive eugenics is the original eugenics,
but, as the writer endeavoured to show at the time,
negative eugenics is one with it in principle. The two
are complementary, and are both practised by Nature:
natural selection is one with natural rejection. To choose
is to refuse.</p>

<p>In regard to positive eugenics I, for one, must
ever make the criticism that I cannot believe in
the propriety of attempting to bribe into parenthood
people who have no love of children: we have to consider
the parental environment of the children we desire,
as well as their innate quality. Thus, positive eugenics
must largely take the form, at present, of removing such
disabilities as now weigh upon the desirable members
of the community, especially of the more prudent sort.</p>

<p>For instance, it was recently pointed out by a correspondent
of the <i>Morning Post</i> that in Great Britain,
despite the alarm caused by the decreasing marriage-rate,
no one has protested against&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p_173" id="p_173">[173]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot">

<p>“... the tax which the propertied middle classes have to pay
on marriage.... To take a few instances. Two persons each
having £160 a year marry. Previous to marriage they were
exempt from income tax; after marriage they pay £6 per annum.
Two persons each having £400 a year pay £18 before and £30
after marriage. Similarly the additional income tax payable on
marriage by people each having £600 a year is £9, by those
having £1,200 a year £30, and by those having £2,000 a year
£50. It is difficult to see how our legislators arrived at this
result unless they started to average the incomes of married people
and then forgot to divide by two.... If, as I contend, a man
and his wife should be counted as two people, not one, should not
children also be counted in any scheme of graduated taxation,
and an income be divided by the number of persons it has to
support in order to fix the rate at which the tax is to be charged?
It is ridiculous to suppose that a man with a wife and six children
is as well off on £1,000 a year as a bachelor with the same
income. It is, I believe, acknowledged that the moderately
well-off professional classes marry later and have fewer children
than the wage-earners, and I think there can be no doubt that the
special burthens they have to bear is a material influence
contributing to this result. Thus, while we are deploring the
decadence of the race, the State is doing what it can to discourage
marriage in a class whose children would in all probability prove
its most valued citizens.”</p></div>

<p>But it is in negative eugenics that we can accomplish
most at this stage, and in so doing can steadily educate
public opinion, the professional jesters notwithstanding.
There is here a field for action which does not demand
a great revolution in the popular point of view; and,
further, does not require us to wait for certainty until
the facts and laws of heredity have been much further
elucidated. The services which a conscious race-culture,
thus directed, may even now accomplish, can scarcely
be over-estimated; and even if we cannot reach the
public heart at once we can reach the public head by
means of the public pocket&mdash;which will benefit obviously
and greatly when these proposals are carried out. As
Thoreau observes, for a thousand who are lopping off
the branches of an evil there is but one striking at its
roots. If we strike at the roots of certain grave and
costly evils of the present day, we shall abundantly
demonstrate that this is a matter of the most vital
economy.</p>

<p><em class="psection">The deaf and dumb.</em>&mdash;We might begin with the case of
the <i>deaf and dumb</i>, since the facts here are utterly beyond<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_174" id="p_174">[174]</a></span>
dispute. The condition known as deaf-mutism is congenital
or due to innate defect in about one-half of
all the cases in Great Britain. Says Dr. Love,<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> “In
every institution examples may be found of deaf-mute
children who have one or two deaf parents or grand-parents,
and of two or more deaf-mute children
belonging to one family.” A recent report from Japan
is of a similar order, and the evidence might be
multiplied indefinitely. The obvious conclusion that
the inherently deaf should not marry “is generally
conceded by those who work amongst the deaf, but the
present arrangements for the education of the deaf,
and their management in missions and institutes for the
deaf during the period of adolescence, is eminently fitted
to encourage union between the congenitally deaf. If
not during the school period, at least during the period
of adolescence, everything should be done to discourage
the association of the deaf and dumb with each other, and
the danger of their meeting with those similarly afflicted
should be constantly kept before the congenitally deaf
by those in charge of them.” Dr. Love quotes the
following newspaper report: “At an inquest yesterday,
on William Earnshaw, 59, a St. Pancras saddler, it was
stated that the relatives could not identify the body,
as the wife and sister were blind, deaf and dumb, and
that the four children were deaf and dumb. The deceased
was deaf and dumb, and was so when he was married.”</p>

<p><em class="psection">The feeble-minded.</em>&mdash;The case of the <i>feeble-minded</i> is of
course parallel. The problem would be at once reduced to
negligible proportions if all cases of feeble-mindedness were
dealt with as they should be. These unfortunate people
might lead quite happy lives, the utmost be done for their
feeble capacities, the supreme demands of the law of love
be completely but providently complied with. The feeble-minded<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_175" id="p_175">[175]</a></span>
girl might be protected from herself and from
others&mdash;her fate otherwise is often too deplorable for
definition&mdash;and the interests of the future be not compromised.
These words were written whilst awaiting the
long overdue Report of the Royal Commission on this
subject&mdash;which abundantly confirms them. The proportion
of the mentally defective in Great Britain is now
0.83 per cent., and it is doubtless rising yearly. Only by
the recognition and application of negative eugenics can
this evil be cured. I have elsewhere<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> discussed the
supposed objection which will be raised in the name of
“liberty” by persons who think in words instead of
realities. The right care of the feeble-minded involves
the greatest happiness and liberty and self-development
possible for them. The interests of the individual and
the race are one. What liberty has the feeble-minded
prostitute, such as our streets are filled with?</p>

<p><em class="psection">The insane.</em>&mdash;As regards obvious <i>insanity</i>, the same
principles of negative eugenics must be enforced. It is
probably fair to say that the whole trend of modern research
has been to accentuate the importance, if not indeed
the indispensableness, of the inherent or inherited factor
in the production of insanity. Yet, on the other hand,
the trend of treatment of the insane has undoubtedly
been towards permitting them more liberty, sometimes
of the kind which the principles of race-culture must
condemn. It is well, of course, that we should be humane
in our treatment of the insane. It is well that curative
medicine should do its utmost for them, and it seems
well, at first sight, that the proportion of discharges
from asylums on the score of recovery should be as high
as it is. But at this point the possibility of the gravest
criticism evidently arises. I have no intention whatever<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_176" id="p_176">[176]</a></span>
of exposing the question of race-culture to legitimate
criticism by laying down dogmatically any doctrines
as to the perpetual incarceration of insane persons,
including those who have been, but are not now, insane.
Pope was, of course, right when he hinted at the nearness
of the relation between <i>certain forms</i> of genius and certain
forms of insanity. It may well be that if we could provide
a fit environment we might welcome the children of
some of those, highly and perhaps uniquely gifted in
brain, who, under the stress of the ordinary environment
of modern life, have broken down for shorter or longer
periods. On the other hand, there are forms of insanity
which, beyond all dispute, should utterly preclude their
victims from parenthood. As a result of recent controversies
it seems on the whole probable, if not certain,
that the apparent persistent increase in the proportion
of the insane in civilised countries generally during
many years past, is a real increase, and not due simply
to such factors as more stringent certification or increase
of public confidence in lunatic asylums. If, then, there
be in process a real increase in the proportion of the
insane, who will question that no time should be lost
in ascertaining the extent&mdash;undoubtedly most considerable&mdash;to
which the principles of negative eugenics can
be invoked in order to arrest it?</p>

<p>As regards <i>epilepsy</i> and <i>epileptic insanity</i> there can
be no question. There is, of course, such a thing as
acquired epilepsy, and we may even assume for the sake
of the argument that no inherent and therefore transmissible
factor of predisposition is involved in such cases.
Yet, wholly excluding them, there remains the vast
majority of cases in which epilepsy and epileptic insanity
are unquestionably germinal in origin, and therefore
transmissible. The principle of negative eugenics cannot
too soon be applied here.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p_177" id="p_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p><em class="psection">The criminal.</em>&mdash;When we come to consider the question
of <i>crime</i> the cautious and responsible eugenist is bound
to be wary&mdash;chiefly, perhaps, because such a vast amount
of sheer nonsense has been written on this subject. The
whole question, of course, is the old one, Is it heredity
or environment that produces the criminal? If and
when it is the environment, race-culture has nothing to
do with the question, since the merely acquired criminality
is, as we know, not in any degree transmissible. If the
criminal, however, is always or ever a “born criminal,”
then the eugenist is intimately concerned. At the one
extreme are those who tell us that the idea of crime is a
purely conventional one, that the criminal is the product
of circumstances or environment, and that we, in his
case, would have done likewise. The remedy for crime,
then, is education. It is pointed out, however, that
education merely modifies the variety of crime. There
is less murder but more swindling, and so forth.
Then, on the other hand, there are those who declare
that criminality is innate, and that if we are to make
an end of crime we must attach surgeons to our gaols;
or at any rate must extend the principle of the life-sentence.</p>

<p>Doubtless, the truth lies between these two extremes.
In the face of the work of Lombroso and his school,
exaggerated though their conclusions often be, we cannot
dispute the existence of the born criminal, and the criminal
type. There are undoubtedly many such persons in
modern society. There is an abundance of crime which
no education, practised or imaginable, would eliminate.
Present-day psychology and medicine, and, for the matter
of that, ordinary common-sense, can readily distinguish
cases at both extremes&mdash;the <i>mattoid</i> or semi-insane criminal
at one end, and the decent citizen who yields to exceptional
temptation at the other end. Thus, even though<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_178" id="p_178">[178]</a></span>
there remain a vast number of cases where our knowledge
is insufficient, we could accomplish great things already
if the born criminal, the habitual criminal and his like
were rationally treated by society, on the lines of the
reformatory, the labour colony, indeterminate sentences,
and such other methods as aim, successfully or unsuccessfully,
at the reform of the individual, whilst
incidentally protecting the race. Here, as in some other
cases, the nature of the environment provided for their
children by certain sections of the community may be
taken into account when we decide whether they are
to be prohibited from parenthood. Heredity or no
heredity, we cannot desire to have children born into
the alcoholic home; heredity or no heredity, we cannot
desire to have children born into the criminal environment.
In Great Britain we are no longer to manufacture criminals
in hundreds by sending children to prison. It remains
to be seen, after the practical disappearance of the made
criminal, what proportion of crime is really due to the
born criminal. He, when found, must certainly be dealt
with on the lines indicated by our principles.<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p><em class="psection">Other cases.</em>&mdash;So far we have considered exclusively
diseases and disorders of the brain, the question of
alcoholism being deferred to a special chapter. When
we come to other forms of defect or disease we find a
long gradation of instances: at the one extreme being
cases where the fact of disastrous inheritance is palpable
and inevitable, whilst at the other extreme are kinds of
disease and defect as to which the share of heredity is still
very uncertain. In some instances, then, the eugenist is
bound to lay down the most emphatic propositions, as,
for instance, that parenthood on the part of men suffering<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_179" id="p_179">[179]</a></span>
from certain diseases is and should and must be regarded
and treated as a crime of the most heinous order: whilst
in other instances all we can say is that here is a direction
in which more knowledge is needed.</p>

<p>Some particular cases may be referred to.</p>

<p>The diseases known as Daltonism or colour-blindness,
and hæmophilia or the “bleeding disease,” are certainly
hereditary. The sufferers are usually male, but the disease
is commonly transmitted by their daughters (who do not
themselves suffer) to their male descendants. As regards
colour-blindness, the defect is evidently insufficient to
concern the eugenist, but hæmophilia is a serious disease,
the transmission of which should not be excused. It
may seem hard to assert that the daughter of a hæmophilic
father should not become a mother, she herself
being free from all disease. But it has to be remembered
that the possibility of this hardship depends upon the
fact that a hæmophilic man has become a father, as
he should not have done.</p>

<p>This point, as to the amount of hardship involved
in the observance of negative race-culture, has always
to be kept in mind. If negative eugenics were generally
enforced upon a given generation some persons would,
of course, suffer in greater or less degree from the
disabilities imposed upon them. But their number
would depend upon the neglect of eugenics by previous
generations, and <i>thereafter the number of those upon
whom our principles pressed hardly would be relatively
minute</i>.</p>

<p><em class="psection">Eugenics and tuberculosis.</em>&mdash;It would not be correct to
say that the old view of consumption regarded it as
hereditary. In this and a hundred other matters, medical,
astronomical, or what we please, if we go back to the
Arabic students, or further, to the Greeks, we are lucky
enough to find sound observation and reasoning. Many<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_180" id="p_180">[180]</a></span>
quotations might be made to show that the infectious
nature of tuberculosis was recognised long ago, just as
the revolution of the earth round the sun was recognised
a millennium and a half before Copernicus. But the view
of our more immediate fathers was that tuberculosis
is a hereditary degeneration, and the medical profession
proclaimed with no uncertain sound the hopeless and
paralysing doctrine that an almost certain doom hung
over the children of the consumptive. Then, in memorable
succession, came Villemin, Pasteur, and lastly Koch,
with his discovery of the bacillus in 1882. The doctrine
was then altered in its statement. There was, of course,
no choice in the matter, since it was easy to show that
not one new-born baby in millions harbours a tubercle
bacillus; so all-but-miraculous and, rightly considered,
beautiful are the ante-natal defences. It was taught,
then, that we inherit a predisposition from consumptive
parents, that the bacillus is ubiquitous, and that variations
in susceptibility determine the incidence of the disease
in one and not in another. It was lightly assumed
(simply through what may be called the inertia of belief)
that these variations in susceptibility were hereditary;
but we are wholly without evidence that the hereditary
factor counts for anything substantial, even assuming
that it appreciably exists at all. These differences, so
far from being inherent, may be <i>most palpably</i> acquired.
Under-feeding, alcohol, and influenza, let us say, will
adequately prepare any human soil. Furthermore, we
are learning that the bacillus is nothing like so ubiquitous
as used to be supposed. Tuberculosis is now sometimes
described as a dwelling disease. It might probably
be described with still more accuracy as a bed-room
disease, or a bed-room and public-house disease. It has
been evident for many years past that the more we
learnt about tuberculosis the less did we talk about<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_181" id="p_181">[181]</a></span>
heredity; and in one of the most recent authoritative
pronouncements<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> upon the subject, the lecturer did not
even allude to heredity at all. Many readers will be up
in arms at once with apparently contrary instances;
and much labour may be spent in the mathematical
analysis of statistical data&mdash;as that of cases where a
father and a child have tuberculosis. But suppose the
father kissed the child? What have you proved regarding
heredity? No mathematics can get more out of the
data than is in them.</p>

<p>The statistics designed to measure the degree of inheritance
in this disease labour under the cardinal fallacy of
assuming that where father and son suffer, the case is one
of inheritance, and then proceed to measure the average
extent of this inheritance. These statistics are so much
waste paper and ink&mdash;assuming what they claim to
prove. They do not allow for the fact that the child
is very frequently exposed in grave measure to infection
by the parent; they ignore wholly, indeed, the entire
question of exposure to infection, both as regards its
extent in time and the virulence of the infection in
question. At the present day, discussions as to the
inheritance of consumption and tuberculosis in general
are not fit for practical application: and a practical
disservice is rendered by those who seek to divert public
attention from the removable environmental causes
upon which the disease mainly depends. We know,
for instance, that the incidence of tuberculosis is directly
proportional to over-crowding: this being universally
true, we must work to abolish over-crowding and to
provide fresh air for every one by day and by night.
When that is done, alcoholism disposed of, and our
milk-supply purified, we may turn to the question of
heredity: but the incidence of the disease will then<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_182" id="p_182">[182]</a></span>
present merely trivial instead of the present appalling
proportions.</p>

<p>It is not asserted that inherent variations in susceptibility
to this disease are not existent. The case would
be unique if it were so. But it is asserted that the more
we learn of the disease the less importance we attach
to this factor, and the more surely do we see that the
three syllables constituting the word “infection” substantially
suffice to dispose of all the confident dogmas
with which we are too familiar. One is almost tempted
to quote a forcible phrase of Mill's, and say that, given
this point of view, “once questioned, they are doomed.”
The only method of accurately studying the question of
inherited predisposition would be by comparative study
of the resistance of new-born infants as measured by
their “opsonic index”&mdash;which may be (very roughly)
described as the measure of the power of the white cells
of the blood to eat up tubercle bacilli.<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> Nor will even
this method be free from fallacy.</p>

<p>The present writer believes that eugenics is going to save
the world; that there is no study of such urgent and
practical importance as that of heredity; that if we
get the right people born and the wrong people not born,
forms of government and such questions will be left
even without fools to contest regarding them. Thus he
has every bias in favour of emphasising the hereditary
factor in tuberculosis. The fact will at least not discredit
the foregoing views, which are in absolute accord
with those of Dr. Newsholme, our leading authority,
in his recent work upon the subject.</p>

<p>Nothing need here be said about cancer, the best
and most recent evidence tending to show that the
disease is not hereditary.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p_183" id="p_183">[183]</a></span></p>
<p>The foregoing may briefly suffice to illustrate the
general proposition that negative eugenics will seek to
define the diseases and defects which are really hereditary,
to name those the transmission of which is already certainly
known to occur, and to raise the average of the race
by interfering as far as may be with the parenthood
of persons suffering from these transmissible disorders.
Only thus can certain of the gravest evils of society, as,
for instance, feeble-mindedness, insanity, and crime due
to inherited degeneracy, be suppressed: and if race-culture
were absolutely incapable of effecting anything
whatever in the way of increasing the fertility of the
worthiest classes and individuals, its services in the
negative direction here briefly outlined would still be
of incalculable value. No other proposal will save so
much life, present and to come: and save so much gold
in doing so&mdash;as one would insist if one were writing a
eugenic primer for politicians. To this policy we shall
most certainly come: but here, as in other cases, I trust
far more in the influence of an educated public opinion
than in legislation; though there are certain forms of
transmissible disease, interfering in no way with the
responsibility of the individual, the transmission of
which should be visited with the utmost rigour of the
law and regarded as utterly criminal no less than sheer
murder.</p>

<p>In the next chapter, recognising marriage as the human
mode of selection, we must consider it in its relation to
eugenics, both positive and negative.</p>

<small>SELECTION THROUGH MARRIAGE</small></h3>


<p><em class="psection">Historical evidence of control of marriage: Westermarck's
evidence.</em>&mdash;To begin with the most recent
refutation of the doctrine that marriage selection is uncontrollable,
one may quote from the inaugural lecture
delivered by Dr. Westermarck in December, 1907, on his
appointment as Professor of Sociology in the University
of London. He said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“For instance, when the suggestion has been made that the law
should step in and prevent unfit individuals from contracting
marriage, the objection has at once been raised that any such
measure would be impracticable. Now we find that many
savages have tried the experiment and succeeded. Mr. Im Thurn
tells us that among the wild Indians of Guiana, a man, before he
is allowed to choose a wife, must prove that he can do a man's
work and is able to support himself and his family. In various
Bechuana and Kaffir tribes, according to Livingstone, a youth is
prohibited from marrying until he has killed a rhinoceros.
Among the Dyaks of Borneo no one can marry until he has in his
possession a certain number of human skulls. Among the Arabs
of Upper Egypt a man must undergo an ordeal of whipping by
the relatives of his bride, in order to test his courage; and if he
wishes to be considered worth having, he must receive the
chastisement, which is sometimes exceedingly severe, with an
expression of enjoyment.</p>

<p>“I do not say that these particular methods are worthy of
slavish imitation, but the principle underlying them is certainly
excellent, and especially the fact that they are recognised and
enforced by custom shows that it has been quite possible among
many people to prohibit certain unfit individuals from marrying.
The question naturally arises whether, after all, something of the
same kind may not be possible among ourselves.”</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p_185" id="p_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p><em class="psection">Mr. Galton's evidence.</em>&mdash;But Mr. Galton himself, with
his characteristic thoroughness, and in full recognition
of the fact that this young science must meet ignorant
as well as other objections, read before the Sociological
Society<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> a paper entitled “Restrictions in Marriage,”
with special reference to the objection “that human
nature would never brook interference with the freedom
of marriage.... How far have marriage restrictions
proved effective, when sanctified by the religion of the
time, by custom and by law? I appeal from armchair
criticism to historical facts.” Mr. Galton then proceeds
to quote seven forms of restriction in marriage which
have actually been practised&mdash;monogamy, endogamy,
exogamy, Australian marriages, taboo, prohibited degrees
and celibacy. He shows how powerful under each of these
heads is the influence of “immaterial motives” upon
marriage selection, how they may all become hallowed
by religion, accepted as custom and enforced by law.
“Persons who are born under their various rules, live
under them without any objection. They are unconscious
of their restrictions as we are unaware of the tension of
the atmosphere.” In many cases the establishment of
monogamy and the prohibition of polygamy “has
been due not to any natural instinct against the practice,
but to consideration of social well-being.” “It was
penal for a Greek to marry a barbarian, for a Roman
patrician to marry a plebeian, for a Hindoo of one caste
to marry one of another caste, and so forth. Similar
restrictions have been enforced in multitudes of communities,
even under the penalty of death.” Cases
from ancient Jewish law are quoted; and, to take a
very different case, that of the marriage rule amongst
the Australian bushmen, it is shown that <span class="pagenum"><a name="p_186" id="p_186">[186]</a></span>“the cogency
of this rule is due to custom, religion and law, and is so
strong that nearly all Australians would be horrified
at the idea of breaking it.” Passing further on, one
need offer no excuse for quoting, regarding marriage
in general, the following words of the founder of eugenics:&mdash;“<i>The
institution of marriage as now sanctified by
religion and safeguarded by law in the more highly civilised
nations, may not be ideally perfect, nor may it be universally
accepted in future times, but it is the best that has hitherto
been devised for the parties primarily concerned, for their
children, for home life, and for society.</i>”</p>

<p>Mr. Galton then proceeds to show how extensive are
the restrictions in marriage already recognised and
practised amongst ourselves and quite contentedly
accepted. He proves also that our objection to marriage
within prohibited degrees depends mainly upon what he
calls immaterial considerations, and adds “it is quite
conceivable that a non-eugenic marriage should hereafter
excite no less loathing than that of a brother and sister
would do now.” Then, in allusion to the possibility “of
a whole-hearted acceptance of eugenics as a national
religion ... the thorough conviction by a nation that
no worthier object exists for man than the improvement
of his own race,” Mr. Galton shows from the history of
conventual life what abundant evidence there is “of the
power of religious authority in directing and withstanding
the tendencies of human nature towards freedom in
marriage.” This paper was discussed by no less than
twenty-six authorities, British and Continental, and in
his reply Mr. Galton observes that not one of them impugns
his main conclusion “that history tells how restrictions
in marriage, even of an excessive kind, have been contentedly
accepted very widely, under the guidance of what
I called immaterial motives.” Lastly, we may note Mr.
Galton's admirable distinction between the two stages
of love, <span class="pagenum"><a name="p_187" id="p_187">[187]</a></span>“that of slight inclination and that of falling
thoroughly into love, for it is the first of these rather than
the second that I hope the popular feeling of the future
will successfully resist. Every match-making mother
appreciates the difference. If a girl is taught to look upon
a class of men as tabooed, whether owing to rank, creed,
connections or other causes, she does not regard them as
possible husbands and turns her thoughts elsewhere.
The proverbial ‘Mrs. Grundy’ has enormous influence
in checking the marriages she considers indiscreet.”</p>

<p>Surely all the foregoing suffices to show, first, that
eugenics or race-culture is compatible with marriage, and
secondly, that it is compatible with the love of the sexes&mdash;two
conclusions of the most cardinal and fundamental
importance. This importance it is, and the obstinate
stupidity of critics of a kind, which must excuse me for
having devoted so much space to propositions which the
thoughtful reader would naturally have arrived at for
himself.</p>

<p><em class="psection">The present influence of marriage on race-culture.</em>&mdash;We
must turn now from the past to the present aspect of the
question, viz., the actual relation of marriage to eugenics
at the present day. Its nature is very much disputed.
On the one hand, there are those who see in our present
methods what has elsewhere been called reversed selection&mdash;that
is to say, an anti-eugenic process, involving the
mating of the least desirable. On the other hand, there
are many conservative critics who, starting from a general
opposition to any new thing, such as eugenics, maintain
that we are doing very well as we are, and that, without
any conscious interference, as they call it&mdash;as if there were
no such interference&mdash;selection by marriage is actually
working for the eugenic end. Dr. Maudsley, for instance,
is “not sure but that nature in its own blind impulsive
way does not manage things better than we can by any
light of reason”: an astounding opinion from the veteran<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_188" id="p_188">[188]</a></span>
pioneer who has devoted so many decades to successfully
modifying natural processes by the light of his own
splendid reason!</p>

<p>This most important question, as to what is actually
happening within the limits of marriage, may legitimately
be regarded as substantially equivalent to the question
of the extent and nature of selection, for good or for evil,
as it occurs in society to-day. If we remember that an
overwhelming proportion of children are born in wedlock,
that the death-rate of illegitimate children is gigantic,
whilst the illegitimate birth-rate is generally falling, we
shall be fully entitled to assume that the answer to the
one question is the answer to the other; in a word, if under
the present conditions of selection for marriage we find a
eugenic tendency or an anti-eugenic tendency or a mere
neutrality, the answer will be, <i>on the whole</i>, the approximate
answer to the larger question as to the present state of
selection for parenthood and therefore of our racial prospects,
marriage or no marriage. The conclusion which
we shall maintain is that <i>both forms of selection occur in
society to-day</i>&mdash;the selection of the desirable and the
selection of the undesirable. We shall go ludicrously wrong
if we agree, with one party, that society in general to-day
exhibits reversed selection; or, with the second party,
that everything is going on admirably on the whole; or,
with the third party, which jumbles the whole mass of
facts and tendencies, and declares that there is no process
of selection of any kind occurring in society to-day&mdash;an
opinion which, in the face of disease, the enormous premature
death-rate, and the fact that whilst vast
numbers of women are unmarried, the choice of women
for marriage does not occur by lot, beggars comment;
is a girl with a birth-mark covering half her face, or a
nose destroyed by transmissible disease, as likely to marry
as a “beauty”? If not, surely we actually select to-day<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_189" id="p_189">[189]</a></span>
for beauty and therefore for whatever beauty depends
upon&mdash;for instance, health. But really it cannot be
necessary to deal seriously with the proposition that no
selection occurs in society to-day.</p>

<p>Let us attempt to state clearly the point at issue. There
is granted, in the first place, that by far the greater part
of all parenthood, in civilised and uncivilised communities
alike, occurs within the limits of marriage; to which may
be added that, owing to the excessive death-rate of illegitimate
children, the proportion of effective parenthood, so
to say, that occurs within the limits of marriage is even
larger; and this intervention of marriage, and any selection
that may be involved in it, steadily recur from
generation to generation. Thus even those born outside
wedlock will nevertheless be selected for parenthood, on
their own part, mainly by the selective factors in marriage.</p>

<p><em class="psection">Selection by marriage has the last word.</em>&mdash;It follows,
then, though the fact is almost constantly ignored by
eugenic writers, that selection by marriage in effect has the
last word. Thus supposing that all other forms of selection,
depending upon, for instance, the various causes of
death amongst the immature, were what we call reversed
selection; or supposing that, as is actually the case,
society permitted large numbers of the so-called unfit to
survive,&mdash;even so, marriage selection (if it meant that
many or most of these were rejected by it) would control
and correct the dangerous tendency. On all hands,
scientific and unscientific, we have writers telling us of
the disastrous multiplication of the unfit. Such multiplication
does occur and is disastrous. Yet hitherto they
have failed to recognise that if&mdash;to take an extreme case&mdash;all
these unfit are rejected by marriage selection&mdash;that is
to say, do not themselves become parents&mdash;this alarming
multiplication is, after all, not a persistent factor in racial
change, but merely the throwing up or throwing aside in<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_190" id="p_190">[190]</a></span>
each generation of a certain number of undesirables <i>whose
breed gets no further</i>. Of course there would be much
less urgent need for eugenics if this last were wholly and
happily the case. Our object, indeed, is to make it the
case: but so long as selection by marriage exists,&mdash;and its
occurrence is palpably indisputable&mdash;<i>it is a serious flaw in
the common argument to assume that the production and
preservation of undesirables necessarily involves their own
parenthood in due course</i>. It is necessary that strict
statistical enquiry be made on this point. It would show,
I believe, that the marriage-rate <i>and the birth-rate</i> amongst
the <i>grossly</i> unfit is much lower than that of the general
community, or, in other words, that the influence and value
of selection by marriage (which, as we have shown, is in
effect selection for parenthood, the only selection that
ultimately matters) has not yet been fully appreciated.
I very strongly incline to the view that if this protective
factor were not constantly at work, the “multiplication
of the unfit” would long ago have led to the destruction
of every civilised nation on the earth: they would have
swamped us long ago. Indeed, the proposition may
be laid down that, supreme and indispensable as are
the services of marriage to race-culture, in its protection
of motherhood, and the support of motherhood by fatherhood,
probably the services of marriage as in effect the
working of sexual selection are worthy of being rated
almost, if not quite, as high.</p>

<p><em class="psection">Sexual selection is certainly true of mankind.</em>&mdash;Before
adducing the outlines of the evidence in favour of marriage
as an instrument of selection, it may be well to point out
that here we are really discussing what Darwin called
“sexual selection,” modified by the psychology and
peculiar characters of mankind. We must protect ourselves
from the critics who will remind us that sexual
selection is very largely discredited to-day, rather more<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_191" id="p_191">[191]</a></span>
than a generation after Darwin's enunciation of it in
<i>The Descent of Man</i> (1871). The controversy regarding
sexual selection as the producer of feathers and markings
and song, and so forth, amongst the lower animals, is
fortunately quite irrelevant to our present discussion,
which is concerned with mankind. We can afford to note
with equanimity the observation that, in lower species, no
mature female goes unmated, for instance; the fact remains
that in the case of mankind a very considerable
percentage of women remain unmarried. The case is
similar as regards the male sex. In short, one may
declare that, whether or not sexual selection is
possible, or occurs, or accomplishes anything, in the
case of the lower animals, it palpably and patently is
possible, and does occur, amongst mankind, and
especially amongst civilised peoples, in the form of
selection by or for marriage&mdash;which, as we have seen,
is in effect selection for parenthood. Let us first note
the statistical evidence regarding marriage-selection of
health and energy.</p>

<p><em class="psection">Spencer on marital longevity.</em>&mdash;We are all aware that
married people live longer, on the average, than unmarried
people, the conclusion being, “of course,” that marriage
is good for the health. But some are taken and others left
in this respect, and if, for any conceivable reason, health
is a factor making for selection by marriage, that may be
a real explanation, in whole or in part, of the longer life of
married people. Considering the risks to life involved in
motherhood, the superior longevity of married as compared
with unmarried women would be incomprehensible
except on some such assumption. Yet it is the fact, so
imperfect still is the entry of the idea of selection into the
popular and even the expert mind, that the superior
longevity of married people is still constantly asserted
to mean that marriage makes for long life; every<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_192" id="p_192">[192]</a></span>
year, when the statistics are printed, this argument
may be seen in the newspapers, and I remember
encountering it in the <i>Encyclopædia Britannica</i>, to my
utter astonishment.</p>

<p>This uncritical conclusion was disposed of by the author
of the phrase “the survival of the fittest”&mdash;appropriately
enough&mdash;more than thirty years ago. If the reader will
turn to Herbert Spencer's <i>Study of Sociology</i> (a masterpiece
which may be commended to the publishers for the purpose
of indexing&mdash;twenty editions without an index are
too many) he will find in Chapter V. a discussion of this
question. It is an astonishing thing that though Spencer
conclusively exposed it a generation ago, the childish
fallacy is still apparently as flourishing as ever. He shows
how the greater healthfulness of married life was supposed
to be proved by Dr. Stark from comparison of the rates of
mortality among the married and among the celibate.
Then no less an authority than M. Bertillon went into the
matter and contributed a paper called “The Influence of
Marriage”&mdash;thus begging the question in its very title&mdash;to
the Brussels Academy of Medicine. He showed that,
from twenty-five to thirty years of age, several
Continental countries being taken into the reckoning,
“the mortality per thousand is 4 in married men,
10.4 in bachelors, and 22 in widows. This beneficial
influence of marriage is manifested at all ages,
being always more strongly marked in men than
in women.” The absurdity of the apparent conclusion
regarding widows is surely, as Spencer says, too
obvious for discussion. But, for the rest, Spencer goes on
to show that, in reality, “marriage and longevity are
concomitant results of the same cause”&mdash;in other words,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_193" id="p_193">[193]</a></span>“that superior quality of organisation which conduces to
long life also conduces to marriage. It is normally accompanied
by a predominance of the instincts and emotions
prompting marriage; there goes along with it that power<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
which can secure the means of making marriage practicable;
and it increases the probability of success in courtship.”
Spencer shows how “of men whose marriages
depend upon getting the needful income,” those who will
succeed are in general “the best, physically and mentally&mdash;the
strong, the intellectually capable, the morally well-balanced.”
He shows also how “women are attracted
towards men of power&mdash;physical, emotional, intellectual;
and obviously their freedom of choice leads them, in many
cases, to refuse inferior samples of men; especially the
malformed, the diseased, and those who are ill-developed,
physically and mentally. So that, in so far as marriage
is determined by female selection, the average result on
men is that while the best easily get wives, a certain
proportion of the worst are left without wives.”</p>

<p>Very likely the stupid conclusion into which so many
distinguished men have been betrayed will survive for
many years yet amongst less distinguished people, but
at any rate we may free our minds from it here, and may
recognise in the figures to which I have referred, and which
are of the same order to-day, the statistical proof of what
any observer, however casual, might have inferred from
what he sees even amongst his own friends only&mdash;that
marriage is, as it probably always has been, a selective
agent of much value in preserving and augmenting the
desirable inherent qualities of the race. It is, of course,
the object of race-culture or eugenics to strengthen the
hands of marriage in this respect to the utmost possible
degree.</p>

<p><em class="psection">Woman as practical eugenist.</em>&mdash;We must especially
note one most important matter, radically affecting race-culture,
which is referred to by Herbert Spencer in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_194" id="p_194">[194]</a></span>
passage cited, and has been greatly insisted upon by Dr.
Alfred Russel Wallace, the co-discoverer with Darwin of
the principle of natural selection. The matter in question
is the possibility of race-culture through the choice of
their husbands by women. Not long ago Dr. Wallace<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>
described selection through marriage as the “more permanently
effective agency through which the improvement
of human character may be achieved.” This, in his
opinion, can only be perfectly achieved “when a greatly
improved social system renders all our women economically
and socially free to choose; while a rational and
complete education will have taught them the importance
of their choice both to themselves and to humanity.... It
will act through the agency of well-known facts and principles
of human nature, leading to a continuous reduction
of the lower types in each successive generation, and it is
the only mode yet suggested which will automatically
and naturally effect this.” Thus “for the first time in the
history of mankind his Character&mdash;his very Human
Nature itself&mdash;will be improved by the slow but certain
action of a pure and beautiful form of selection&mdash;a selection
which will act, not through struggle and death, but
through brotherhood and love.”</p>

<p>Dr. Wallace is a socialist, and he believes that only
through socialism can we achieve “that perfect freedom
of choice in marriage which will only be possible when all
are economically equal, and no question of social rank
or material advantage can have the slightest influence
in determining that choice.” As I have said elsewhere,
I would call myself neither a socialist nor an anti-socialist,
but if labels are necessary, a eugenist and maternalist.
As such, I can only say that this argument for socialism&mdash;that
it is the necessary condition of eugenics or race-culture&mdash;is,
for me, incomparably the best argument<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_195" id="p_195">[195]</a></span>
for that creed; and if it were proved that only through
socialism could the utmost be made of women's choice
of husbands, then no argument against socialism
could have any appreciable weight at all. The fundamental
and permanent argument against certain of
the highly various and incompatible doctrines which,
for our confusion, are commonly lumped together as
socialism, is that they would arrest the process by which
Nature rewards worth and permits it to perpetuate
itself. If, then, it can be shown, as may or may not
be the case, that only through socialism can male worth
be most effectively chosen and male unworth be rejected
for fatherhood, the supreme&mdash;that is, the eugenic&mdash;argument
against socialism becomes the conclusive
argument in its favour.</p>

<p><em class="psection">The field of choice.</em>&mdash;But, however this may be, there
can be no question that the eugenic purpose, as well as
the happiness and elevation of individuals in the present,
will be greatly served by whatever measures increase, to
the utmost extent possible, the opportunities for choice in
marriage afforded to women and also to men. One of the
most amazing and satisfactory facts about marriage as at
present practised is, I think, the large proportion&mdash;often
estimated at seventy-five per cent.&mdash;of unions which,
apart from any eugenic question, turn out happily, in
Great Britain, at any rate. What makes this fact more
amazing is the almost incredible limitation of the field
of choice within which both sexes are still confined as a
whole. If the reader will consider the cases most familiar
to him or her, it will surely be admitted that the considerable
success of marriage takes on an astonishing aspect
when the present strait conditions of choice are taken
into account. I am convinced that few more radical and
far-reaching, because eugenic, reforms can be conceived
than any which, in accordance with Dr. Wallace's<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_196" id="p_196">[196]</a></span>
argument, tend to widen the field of choice, and that not
for one sex only but for both. He would be a rash man
who ventured to allot superior value to the selection of
man by woman rather than of woman by man, or <i>vice
versâ</i>.</p>

<p>Quite apart from any deeper and more difficult
reforms, such as Dr. Wallace alludes to, I am sure that
even the mere widening of the field of choice, as such, is
most desirable. To take an instance, which the reader
may very likely think trivial and absurd, I have witnessed
in my brief career as a hockey player two unions
most happy and eugenic in every way, which entirely
depended upon the existence of the amusement called
mixed hockey&mdash;whereat the contracting parties met one
another! It is not asserted that these two cases suffice
for world-wide generalisation. They are merely cited as
instances which set at least one hockey player thinking,
even on the field&mdash;the field of choice. It is a great argument,
because it is a eugenic argument, in favour of
community of sports and amusements amongst young
people of both sexes, that it does widen the field of
choice in marriage, and that in doing so it also tends
to favour those factors of selection which the eugenist
would desire to see selected: and this especially as
compared with the ball-room. I think that the reader
will agree that the conditions, the “atmosphere,” the
costume, and the other features of what young people
call a “dance,” whilst undoubtedly serving the purpose
of marriage and widening somewhat a field of choice
which might otherwise be ludicrously and impracticably
restricted, compare most unfavourably with the conditions
of even the mixed hockey field, which, decried though they
often be, are to my mind immeasurably healthier on
every conceivable ground than those of the ball-room,
and not least of all on the eugenic ground of the prominence<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_197" id="p_197">[197]</a></span>
gained by most desirable qualities, of which mere strength
and energy and neuro-muscular skill are quite the least,
whilst unselfishness, capacity for self-control, patience,
real gallantry&mdash;as when a male “full back” refrains
from hitting the ball with all his might against the toes
of a girl “forward”&mdash;the sporting spirit and other true
and radical virtues, are the greatest. It is undoubtedly
the case that the personal factors, physical and psychical,
which determine the mutual attraction of young people,
have dependent upon them the whole of human destiny.
In society to-day, what one may call the incidence of
parenthood, upon which all the future necessarily
depends, <i>is</i> determined by nothing other than the
humanised form of what Darwin called “sexual selection.”
Therefore, it is not trivial but supremely important to
discuss the conditions under which the selection obtains.<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>It has already been suggested that in order to enhance
the eugenic value of marriage we should endeavour to
widen the field of choice, at present ludicrously restricted
by custom, class, religion, economic position, and so forth.
The increased locomotion of to-day will be of real eugenic
service to the race in this respect, I believe.</p>

<p>Then it has been hinted that young people should
meet one another under conditions which make prominent
the psychical and put the merely physical or animal
into the background&mdash;<i>e.g.</i> on the hockey field or the
ice or in the “literary circle,” rather than in the ball-room.
This proposition accords, of course, with what
has been said elsewhere as to that great factor of progress
which I define as the enhancement of the survival-value
of the psychical as against that of the physical. (Note<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_198" id="p_198">[198]</a></span>
the obvious sequence&mdash;survival-value, selection-value,
marriage-value, parenthood-value, progress-value.) This
proposition and the last might both be worked out,
I believe, in considerable detail and not without profit.</p>

<p>Arguing on the same lines, we may agree that even
such a small matter, usually considered wholly domestic,
as the length of engagements, is of eugenic or racial
importance. The eugenist, I think, must welcome long
engagements simply because, though they may involve
a reduced marriage-rate and a reduced birth-rate&mdash;the
latter partly in consequence of the reduced marriage-rate,
and partly because of the later age at marriage&mdash;they
tend by the mere operation of time, as we say, to
enhance the importance of the psychical and to reduce
the importance of the physical factors which determine
sexual attraction.</p>

<p>To these three points a fourth, of great importance,
must be added. It is that we should favour, as far as
possible, those factors of choice for marriage which are
inherent, and therefore transmissible, as against those
which are acquired, accidental, and therefore not transmissible,
<i>and therefore</i> of no racial or eugenic importance.
This, of course, is the point made by Dr. Wallace in the
article quoted above&mdash;or at any rate it is involved in
the point he makes. I simply mean that every time a
marriage is brought about by, for instance, money, the
eugenic value of marriage is at least nullified and may
become actually anti-eugenic. Again I say, <i>if</i> Socialism,
or the abolition of (<i>un</i>-natural) inheritance, be necessary
in order that selection for marriage shall be determined by
the possession of personal qualities of racial value rather
than the power of the purse, which has always been a racial
curse, then the sooner socialism is established the better.</p>

<p><em class="psection">The eugenic value of contemporary marriage.</em>&mdash;The
first purpose of this chapter has been to show that<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_199" id="p_199">[199]</a></span>
in marriage, wherever, and in so far as, it is determined
by the mutual attractiveness of young people, there
exists a eugenic factor in society to-day; and since
the race is in effect recruited by the married people,
this aspect of marriage deserves the closest study and
attention. I commend this subject, <i>the eugenic value
of contemporary marriage</i>, to the small but rapidly increasing
number of students who realise that eugenics
or race-culture will be the supreme science of the future,
and who are now devoting themselves to its foundations.
No more important and urgent enquiry can be undertaken
at this stage. Which, for instance, is the more
eugenic, the English system or the French?</p>

<p>The second purpose has been to show that one may
believe in and work for eugenics or race-culture without
proposing to overthrow all human institutions, or
to adopt the methods of the stud-farm, or to initiate a
vast campaign of surgery, or sensational and drastic
legislation, or even, yet, the employment of marriage
certificates. One or all of these things may have their
place, now or hereafter; or may, on the other hand, be
far worse than futile. But most assuredly it is possible
now for the individual parent of marriageable children,
for the clergyman, the leader of fashion, the doctor, not
to start but to strengthen such by no means impotent
eugenic forces as already exist in society, without outraging
sentiment or custom&mdash;indeed, without attracting
public attention to their action at all.</p>

<p>Eugenics has already suffered much at the hands
of its so-called friends. It is to be hoped that a real
service may be discharged by this attempt to show that
on the highest, most accurate and scientific eugenic
grounds, we may recognise, claim and welcome every
father and mother who desire that the son or daughter
whom they care for shall marry for psychical and not<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_200" id="p_200">[200]</a></span>
for physical love. Every such parent is a eugenist, in
effect, though his sole motive may be the welfare of his
individual child.</p>

<p>At present we interfere with marriage on every imaginable
ground, many utterly trivial, many worse. We
encourage or discourage on economic grounds; we
recognize many taboos, of caste, creed, colour. It is not
for us, certainly, acting as we do, to be offended at the
suggestion that we should use our influence to affect
marriage on the highest conceivable ground&mdash;the life of
mankind to come. What we really need is not so much
the abolition of Mrs. Grundy as her conversion to the
eugenic idea. It is the business of those who believe
that eugenics is the greatest ideal in the world to make
a eugenist of Mrs. Grundy, as we shall some day: and
then it will be realised how potent for good public opinion
may become, once it is rightly educated.</p>

<p>Says Mr. Galton, in his latest contribution to the
subject:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The power of social opinion is apt to be rather under-rated
than over-rated. Like the atmosphere which we breathe and by
which we live, social opinion operates powerfully without
our being conscious of its existence. Everyone knows that
governments, manners, and beliefs which were thought to be
right, decorous, and true at one period have been judged wrong,
indecorous, and false at another; and that views which we have
heard expressed by those in authority over us in our childhood and
early manhood tend to become axiomatic and unchangeable in
mature life.</p>

<p>“Speaking for myself only, I look forward to local eugenic action
in numerous directions, including the accumulation of considerable
funds to start young couples of ‘worthy’ qualities in their
married life, and to assist them and their families at critical
times. The gifts to those who are the reverse of ‘worthy’ are
enormous in amount; it is stated that the charitable donations
in the year 1907 amounted to £4,868,050. I am not prepared to
say how much of this was judiciously spent, or in what ways, but
merely quote the figures to justify the inference that many of<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_201" id="p_201">[201]</a></span>
the thousands of persons who are willing to give freely at the
prompting of a sentiment based upon compassion, might be
persuaded to give largely also in response to a more virile
sentiment, based on the desire of promoting the natural gifts and
the National Efficiency of future generations.</p>

<p>“In circumscribed communities especially, social approval and
disapproval exert a potent force. Its presence is only too
easily read by every one who is the object of either, in
the countenances, bearing, and manner of those with whom they
daily meet and converse. Is it then, I ask, too much to expect
that when a public opinion in favour of Eugenics has once taken
sure hold of such communities and has been accepted by them as
a quasi-religion, the result will be manifested in sundry and very
effective modes of action which are as yet untried and many of
them even unforeseen?”</p></div>

<p><em class="psection">“Breach of promise” and race-culture.</em>&mdash;It may be
added that perhaps we shall have to learn to reconsider
our ill-judged and stupid censoriousness, directed against
young people who get engaged but then become tired
of one another&mdash;as they accurately say, discover that
they are not suited for one another. Not only is it
obvious that we are fools in denouncing this discovery of
impermanence in their attraction, happily made before
marriage, whilst we ignore the disasters of its lamentably
<i>postmature</i> discovery, after marriage: but also it should
be obvious that the eugenic end is negatively served
whenever what would have been an unfortunate union
is broken off in time. Our imbecile standard of honour,
and the law of breach of promise, which is outrageously
abused, at present condemn the man, for instance, who
finds that he has made a mistake, whilst passively
applauding him who, finding his mistake, thinks it his
duty to make it irreparable. Far better would it be that
the man incapable of forming an attachment made of
the non-material ties which last, should not marry at
all. The man who cannot see, or seeing, cannot find
it in his heart to love, the spiritual beauties of<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_202" id="p_202">[202]</a></span>
womanhood, is just the man who can be safely omitted
in the eugenist's scheme for fatherhood.</p>

<p>The plea of insanity is, in English law, no protection
against a claim for damages for breach of promise to
marry, unless it be proved insanity at date of contract
in the defendant. A valid contract once made, it is no
excuse for non-performance that insanity has been discovered
in the family of the other party. This wicked
law must be altered.</p>

<p><em class="psection">The need for further study.</em>&mdash;In his study of this
subject the student will naturally turn to Mr. Havelock
Ellis's volume entitled <i>Sexual Selection in Man</i>.<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> This,
of course, has its own scientific value as a statement
of facts, notwithstanding its intensely nauseating
character. But anything less relevant to what most
of us understand by psychology it would be difficult
to imagine. The book considers <i>seriatim</i>, touch,
smell, hearing, and vision as the bases of so-called
love. It thus deals with “sensology,” not psychology.
Indeed, to the best of one's recollection, after very close
and careful reading, there is no allusion to the human
mind in it anywhere. If men and women were simply
animals, this book would doubtless cover the ground, and
perhaps the word “psychology” would even be justified
in connection with it. From end to end men and women
are consistently treated as animals and no more. Since,
however, the human species is possessed of psychical
characters which distinguish it from the lower animals,
it is not unreasonable to suppose that a volume which
really dealt with sexual selection in man would, to say the
least of it, recognise the existence of those characters&mdash;even
if only to reject them as irrelevant to the subject
under discussion.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p_203" id="p_203">[203]</a></span></p>
<p>The foregoing remarks do not imply that the purely
anatomical and sensory factors are irrelevant to the selection
of parents in any generation, and for methodological
purposes it might be of value to abstract from the factors
of sexual selection in human society such things as odour
and contour. But it would be urgently necessary in
the course of such a study, if it were to be other than
extremely misleading, to observe that this selection of
factors was made for purposes of convenience and that
the relation of their importance to that of other factors
was a matter for further and by no means casual consideration.</p>

<p>We may certainly agree with Mr. Havelock Ellis that
sexual selection occurs in human society, and may
welcome his volume as supporting that assertion. There
follows the extremely interesting and indeed urgent
necessity of ascertaining what the factors of this selection
really are, what is their relative potency, and what
is their capacity for modification. We may further
enquire whether they tend to be eugenic. A contribution
to this subject is furnished by Mr. Ellis when he shows
that width of “hips” is a female character commonly
admired by men. Since a wide pelvis is one which can
accommodate and safely give birth to a large fœtal head,
there is here, as a practically solitary case, a bearing on
the eugenic issue: large heads mean, in general, large
brains, and it would be ill for the white races if men
admired hips as narrow as those of, for instance, the
negress, whose pelvis could not find room for the average
head of a purely white baby, and who suffers terribly in
many cases where the father is white, especially if the
child be a boy.</p>

<p>Meanwhile we must wait for studies of this great
question from various points of view: notably for
a study of the economics of sexual selection as it<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_204" id="p_204">[204]</a></span>
obtains in human society. Yet further, we require a
detailed study of the influence of legislation, custom and
public opinion upon sexual selection&mdash;on the lines of
Mr. Galton's paper on “Restrictions in Marriage.”
Mr. Havelock Ellis has more than adequately dealt with
the nervous physiology of sexual selection; there remain
the psychology and sociology of it&mdash;these latter comprehending,
one may suppose, ninety-nine per cent. of
the whole subject. In the preceding pages allusion has
been made to one or two of the more salient aspects
of this matter.</p>

<small>THE RACIAL POISONS: ALCOHOL<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></small></h3>


<p>In the first chapter of our second Part, which deals
with the practice of eugenics, there were introduced,
defined, and briefly illustrated, the terms <i>positive eugenics</i>
and <i>negative eugenics</i>. Of these the latter, as the more
urgent and the more completely and immediately practicable,
claims our special attention; though the present
writer, notwithstanding that he has devoted to it the
greater part of his eugenic work, is bound to protest that
the positive increase of ability and worth is never to be
regarded as of secondary importance. The two methods
are, of course, complementary in practice, as they are
one in principle&mdash;to select is to reject, to choose is
to refuse. The preceding chapter, on selection (and
rejection) through marriage, has dealt with the conditions
under which both aims are to be pursued.
In the following pages we must discuss a specially urgent
and practicable and indisputable portion of negative
eugenic practice: none the less urgent because of the
contemporary emergence and future world-importance of
sober nations, such as Japan and Turkey. The term
<i>racial poisons</i>, introduced by the present writer in the
year 1907, is self-explanatory. After dealing with the
most important of these poisons, we shall proceed, in the
next chapter, to discuss some others. The racial poisons
constitute a special department of eugenics which has<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_206" id="p_206">[206]</a></span>
not hitherto been considered by the pioneers of this
subject, but for which I press the claim of the utmost
gravity and moment, and which I conceive to be certainly
a part, and a most important part, of our manifold yet
single subject.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The argument of this chapter is that parenthood must
be forbidden to the dipsomaniac, the chronic inebriate or
the drunkard, whether male or female; and this whether
Lamarck or Galton and Weismann be right, or whether,
as we may believe with Galton and Weismann themselves,
the controversy between the two parties is
wholly irrelevant to the question in hand. This conclusion,
that on no grounds whatever, theoretical or
practical, can we continue to permit parenthood on
the part of the drunkard, is one temperance reform,
perhaps the only one, on which disagreement is absolutely
impossible. It is, further, the most radical that can be
named within the sphere of practical politics, and it is
conspicuously practicable. It has hitherto been lamentably
neglected by workers and reformers of all schools.
Indeed, at the time of writing, the London County Council,
governing the greatest city in the world, is pursuing a
course of action in this regard, which will be detailed
later, and which, as will appear, is misguided and
deplorable in the last degree.</p>

<p><em class="psection">Alcohol and heredity.</em>&mdash;According to Dr. Archdall Reid,
“alcohol, year after year, eliminates from the race a
great number of people so constituted that intoxication
affords them keen delight, leaving the perpetuation of the
race in great measure to those on whom intoxication
confers little or no delight.... Now since alcohol weeds
out enormous numbers of people of a particular type, it
is a stringent agent of selection&mdash;an agent of selection
more stringent than any one disease.” The factor that<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_207" id="p_207">[207]</a></span>
really makes the drunkard “is certainly inborn, and
therefore as certainly transmissible to offspring. The
man who has it is cursed with the ‘alcohol diathesis,’
with the ‘predisposition to drunkenness.’ Thus most
savages are keenly capable of enjoying drink, and their
offspring inherit the capacity.” Féré has shown that
“it is one of the characteristics of the degenerate that
they are prone to have recourse to the poisons, like
alcohol and morphia, which hasten their decadence and
elimination.” Thus, as Dr. W. C. Sullivan points out,
alcohol “might certainly be adjudged a salutary evil if
its incidence were limited to individuals whose extreme
inferiority of organisation renders them wholly undesirable
and useless to the community. <i>But this is very far
from being the case.</i>”<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>The whole crux of the question lies in this last sentence.
Alcohol certainly destroys many degenerate stocks, and
that is good, though it would be better to do what we
shall do some day&mdash;hasten and ameliorate the process
by forbidding parenthood to the degenerate. <i>But does
alcohol also make degenerates; does it even make more
degenerates than it destroys?</i> A somewhat similar difficulty
arises in the case of infant mortality. The causes of
infant mortality destroy many children inherently unfit,
diseased or weakly. But we are not justified in keeping
up our infant mortality, if we find, as we do, that for
every diseased child whom they destroy they kill
many who were healthy at birth and damage for life
many more.</p>

<p>A man is born sober&mdash;in most cases, but not always,<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>
as we shall see&mdash;and any changes produced in his body
by alcohol are “acquired.” Therefore, rejecting Lamarck,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_208" id="p_208">[208]</a></span>are we to reject the doctrine that the effects produced by
alcohol on parents are transmitted to offspring?</p>

<p>The controversy between Lamarck and Weismann has
<i>absolutely nothing to do with the question</i>. Let us consider
what would be a case of Lamarckian transmission in the
sense which the modern student of heredity denies. The
birth of a child with a scar on its scalp, to a father who
had acquired a similar scar before the child was conceived,
would be such a case: and this does not happen. Or
suppose that instead of a scar on the scalp the father
has an inflammatory change, not so dissimilar to a scar,
produced by alcohol in the membranes covering his brain.
Then it would be a case of Lamarckian transmission if
the membranes of his baby's brain were similarly affected;
and this does not happen. Such is the kind of transmission
of which exhaustive experiment and observation
fail to find a conclusive instance anywhere.</p>

<p>But what has such a supposition to do with the theory,
as definitely supported by observation and experiment
as the other is not, that if a man saturates his body with
alcohol carried by his blood, he injures all the tissues
which are nourished by that blood, including the racial
elements of his body with the rest: and therefore that
his child may be degenerate?</p>

<p>What says Weismann himself? In <i>The Germ-Plasm</i>,
p. 386, under the heading “The influence of temporary
abnormal conditions of the parents on the child,” he
writes as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p_209" id="p_209">[209]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot">

<p>“Although I do not consider that the cases which come under
the above heading have anything to do with heredity, I should
not like to leave them entirely on one side.</p>

<p>“It has often been supposed that drunkenness of the parents at the
time of conception may have a harmful effect on the nature of the
offspring. The child is said to be born in a weak bodily and mental
condition, and inclined to idiocy, or even to madness, etc., although
the parents may be quite normal both physically and mentally.</p>

<p>“Cases certainly exist in which drunken parents have given rise
to a completely normal child, although this is not a convincing
proof against the above-named view; and in spite of the fact that
most, or perhaps even all, the statements with regard to the
injurious effects on the offspring will not bear a very close
criticism,<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> I am unwilling to entirely deny the <i>possibility</i> that a
harmful influence may be exerted in such cases. These, however,
have nothing to do with heredity, but are concerned with an
<i>affection of the germ by means of an external influence</i>.”</p></div>

<p>Weismann goes on to quote cases showing how germ-cells
may be injured by various agents, and continues:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It does not appear to me impossible that an intermixture of
alcohol with the blood of the parents may produce similar effects
on the ovum and sperm cell. According to the relative quantity of
alcohol either an exciting or a depressing influence might be
exerted, either of which would lead to abnormal development....</p>

<p>“<i>New</i> predispositions can certainly never arise owing to such
deviations from the normal course of development, and therefore a
modification of the process of heredity itself is out of the question.
It is, however, conceivable that more or less considerable
abnormalities may affect the course of development, and either
cause the death of the embryo, or else produce more or less
marked deformities. The question as to whether such deformities
really result in consequence of the drunken condition of the
parents can only be decided by observation.”<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p></div>

<p>This is all that Weismann has to say on the subject,
since, not referring to functionally-produced modifications,<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>
it does not concern his theory of heredity at all: yet it is
upon this theory that the most palpable facts of the
racial influence of alcohol are denied. Weismann's own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_210" id="p_210">[210]</a></span>remarks are quite open to criticism, as, for instance,
where he denies that new predispositions can arise in the
manner indicated. This is possibly only a question of
words, and Weismann is perhaps merely denying that
alcohol can produce progressive variations. Also his
remarkably brief discussion of the subject seems to concern
itself mainly with the influence of alcohol on the
germ-cells <i>just before their union</i>. He has not a word to
say regarding the influence on the germinal tissues of
years of soaking in alcohol. It suffices, however, to make
the point which is quite clearly made, that the Weismannians
are going absurdly beyond their book in denying
what, indeed, the book of Nature demonstrates.</p>

<p>Let us turn now to the experimental side of this question.
An American botanist, Dr. T. D. MacDougal, read
an address on “Heredity and Environic Forces” at the
Chicago Meeting of the American Association for the
Advancement of Science in 1907. His experiments require
confirmation, but may be provisionally accepted.
He has permanently modified the germ-plasm of plants
under the influence of various chemicals. There is here
a vast field for experiment with alcohol. I quote one
paragraph indicating the remarkable results of these
experiments. The reader will see their bearing on our
present question, and will also see that they do not for a
moment affect Weismann's denial of the doctrine that by
cutting off rats' tails you can produce a race of tailless
rats, or that by learning a language you can save your
future children the trouble of doing so for themselves:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p_211" id="p_211">[211]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot">

<p>“It was found that the injection of various solutions into
ovaries of Raimannia was followed by the production of seeds
bearing qualities not exhibited by the parent, wholly irreversible,
and fully transmissible in successive generations. One of the
seeds produced by a plant of <i>Œnothera biennis</i> which had been
treated with zinc sulphate differed so widely from the parental
form that it could be distinguished from it by a novice. This
new form has been tested to the third generation, and transmits
all its characteristics fully.”</p></div>

<p><em class="psection">Alcohol a proved racial poison.</em>&mdash;But the reader will
rightly desire some kind of experimental proof that
alcohol itself can act as a cause of racial degeneration. We
may first refer to the chapter on alcoholism and human
degeneration in Dr. W. C. Sullivan's <i>Alcoholism, a Chapter
in Social Pathology</i>,<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> for a recent <i>résumé</i> of the subject.
Without actually quoting Weismann, Dr. Sullivan begins
by showing that, as we have seen, the doctrinal objection
of Dr. Reid and others to the theory of alcoholic degeneration
is quite irrelevant&mdash;“the effects attributed to
parental alcoholism are not in the category of transmitted
acquirements at all; they are the results, expressed in
defect and deviation of development, of a deleterious
influence exerted on the germ-cells, either directly through
the alcohol circulating in the blood, or indirectly, through
the deterioration of the parental organism in which these
cells are lodged, and from which they draw their nutriment.”
Later Dr. Sullivan points out that the racial
effects of alcoholism in man are similar to those obtained
by experimental intoxication in the lower animals.
Combemale, for instance, found that pups begotten of a
healthy bitch by an alcoholised dog were congenitally
feeble and showed a marked degree of asymmetry of the
brain. Recent experiments have shown the same thing
as regards other poisons, and it is especially to be noted
that in the experiments cited the mother was healthy.
They prove that <i>paternal</i> alcoholism alone (all questions
of the nourishment of the growing child before birth,
for instance, thus being excluded) can determine degeneration.
Mr. Galton<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> himself long ago quoted the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_212" id="p_212">[212]</a></span>case “of a man who, after begetting several normal
children, became a drunkard and had imbecile offspring”;
and another case has been recorded “of a healthy woman
who, when married to a drunken husband, had five sickly
children, dying in infancy, but in subsequent union with
a healthy man, bore normal and vigorous children.”</p>

<p>Other intoxications show similar results though they are
not <i>yet</i> of grave racial importance. For instance, “a
man who had had two healthy children acquired the
cocaine habit, and while suffering from the symptoms of
chronic poisoning engendered two idiots.” Brouardel
and others have observed that the expectant mother
who is a morphinomaniac may give birth to a child
who shows all the phenomena of the morphia habit.</p>

<p>Demme has traced the appalling contrast between the
offspring in ten sober families, and in ten families where
one or both parents suffered from chronic alcoholism.
Dr. Sullivan himself, realising the obviously greater
importance of maternal alcoholism, since here we have
the action of poisoned food&mdash;the maternal blood&mdash;upon
the child before birth, made an enquiry of his own. He
found that</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“... of 600 children born of 120 drunken mothers 335 (55.8
per cent.) died in infancy or were still-born, and that several
of the survivors were mentally defective, and as many as 4.1
per cent. were epileptic. Many of these women had female
relatives, sisters or daughters, of sober habits and married to
sober husbands; on comparing the death-rate amongst the
children of the sober mothers with that amongst the children
of the drunken women of the same stock, the former was found
to be 23.9 per cent., the latter 55.2 per cent., or nearly two
and a half times as much. It was further observed that in the
drunken families there was a progressive rise in the death-rate
from the earlier to the later born children.”</p></div>

<p>Dr. Sullivan cites as a typical alcoholic family one in
which <span class="pagenum"><a name="p_213" id="p_213">[213]</a></span>“the first three children were healthy, the fourth
was of defective intelligence, the fifth was an epileptic
idiot, the sixth was dead-born, and finally the productive
career ended with an abortion.” Dr. Claye Shaw told
the Interdepartmental Committee on Physical Deterioration,
“we have inebriate mothers, and either abortions
or degenerate children. The teleological<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> relationship
between the two seems to be as certain as any other
conditions of cause and effect.” The general rule is that
any narcotic substance affects highly developed tissues
sooner and more markedly than simpler tissues, and so
it is in the case of alcohol and the infant. It is the
developing nervous system that is most markedly affected.
This leads, of course, to an increased child mortality,
especially by way of convulsions. This was the cause of
sixty per cent. of all the deaths that occurred amongst the
six hundred children in Dr. Sullivan's series. But it has
especially to be remembered that a large number of children
whose nervous systems are injured for life by parental and
more especially by maternal alcoholism do not die either as
infants or children. Instead of dying of convulsions they
live as epileptics. Of the children in Dr. Sullivan's
series “219 lived beyond infancy, and of these 9, or
4.1 per cent., became epileptic, as compared with 0.1
per cent. of the whole population.” Other observers
have found epilepsy in 12 per cent. and even 15 per cent.
of the children of alcoholic parents. Of course these
data, as such, do not demonstrate Dr. Sullivan's conclusion
that “this action of alcoholism on the health and
vitality of the stock is the most serious of the evils that
intemperance brings on the community.”</p>

<p>Dr. Sullivan's enquiries show a very high rate of still-births
and abortions amongst the children of drunken
mothers&mdash;quite sufficient to prove that <span class="pagenum"><a name="p_214" id="p_214">[214]</a></span>“the detrimental
effect of maternal alcoholism must be in a large measure
due to a direct influence on the germ-cells and on the
developing embryo, and cannot be explained as merely
a result of the neglect and malnutrition from which the
children of a drunken mother are naturally apt to suffer.”
The point is of some theoretical importance. Practically
it matters little; <i>in either case the drunken woman must
not become a mother</i>.</p>

<p>The same conclusion is reached even though we accord
unlimited weight to the unquestionably valid argument
that the drunkard is himself or herself usually degenerate
from the first, and that the children are therefore degenerate,
and would indeed be degenerate even if the
parents had taken no alcohol. Let us, then, erroneously
enough, but for the sake of the argument, assume that
solely and always alcoholism is a symptom of degeneracy.
It is, then, an indication of unfitness for parenthood no
less, and the practical issue is the same: one radical
cure for alcoholism, at any rate, is the prohibition of
parenthood on the part of the alcoholic.<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p><em class="psection">The most recent evidence.</em>&mdash;The most thorough and
comprehensive enquiry into this matter yet made is
also the most recent. We owe it to Dr. W. A. Potts,
of the University of Birmingham, who did valuable work
as Medical Investigator to the Royal Commission on the
Care and Control of the Feeble-minded. His paper,<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_215" id="p_215">[215]</a></span>
entitled “The Relation of Alcohol to Feeble-mindedness,”
is printed in the <i>British Journal of Inebriety</i> for
January, 1909, together with communications from many
authorities. It is quite impossible to summarise here
the enormous mass of evidence which Dr. Potts has
accumulated from the literature of the subject, and to
which he has added his own work. I believe that nothing
could be more moderate and assured than the following
conclusions, to which he commits himself after a study
of the subject the quality and range of which can only
be appreciated at first hand:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“... the evidence is not clear that alcoholism, by itself, in
the father will produce amentia; but it is quite plain that in
combination with other bad factors it is a most unfavourable
element, while maternal drinking, and drinking continued through
more than one generation, are potent influences in mental
degeneracy.”</p></div>

<p>It is impossible, within the scope of the present volume,
to analyse in detail the Report of the Royal Commission
on the Care and Control of the Feeble-minded. In this
present outline of eugenics it is our business, however,
to show main principles, and as the principle expressed
in the phrase “racial poisons” is to my mind absolutely
cardinal for eugenics, it is necessary here to comment,
as I have already done in the <i>Journal</i> above quoted,
upon the following most unfortunate deliverance of the
Commissioners: “That both on the grounds of fact
and of theory, there is the highest degree of probability
that feeble-mindedness is usually spontaneous in
origin&mdash;that is, not due to influences acting on the
parent....”</p>

<p>The word spontaneous has, of course, no meaning for
science, or rather is a denial of the fundamental axiom
of science that causation is universal. What the
Commissioners mean when they say spontaneous is<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_216" id="p_216">[216]</a></span>
“sportaneous,” like the occasional production of a nectarine
by a peach tree. Apart from this highly suspicious
phraseology, there is the still more unfortunate fact that
the Commissioners have lent their authority to the view
that feeble-mindedness is not due to influences acting on
the parent. The modern student of syphilis will be
astonished at this pronouncement, and also the student of
lead-poisoning, as we shall see in the following chapter.</p>

<p>Every reader of Dr. Potts's admirable paper will
realise that this conclusion of the Commissioners&mdash;“not
due to influences acting on the parent”&mdash;is directly
opposed to an extraordinary mass of evidence and to the
opinion of, I suppose, every authority on the subject,
British, Continental or American. The Commissioners'
reference to “theory,” coupled with portions of the
evidence given before them by witnesses who suppose
that the alleged influence of alcohol as a cause of feeble-mindedness
controverts the doctrine of the non-transmission
of “acquired characters,” makes it necessary to
point out for the hundredth time that, for lack of analysis
and criticism of terms, the most prominent followers of
Galton and Weismann persistently misunderstand their
masters' teaching. The modern doctrine of the individual
as the trustee of the germ-cells and of the
non-transmission of acquired characters is Mr. Galton's.
Mr. Galton himself does not question and never has
questioned the possibility that alcohol may cause feeble-mindedness.
There is no reason why he should. If we
take the somewhat unusual course of consulting the
words of the masters before we swear by them, we find&mdash;as
has been shown&mdash;that Weismann, who subsequently
stated and has so greatly supported Mr. Galton's view,
has expressly repudiated the Commissioners' idea of his
“theory.” The Galton-Weismann doctrine is a doctrine
of heredity proper,&mdash;the organic relation of living generations.<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_217" id="p_217">[217]</a></span>
It does not assert that there are two unconnected
universes&mdash;the one made of germ-plasm and the other of
the rest of nature. The “grounds of theory,” or rather,
our elementary physiological knowledge of the nutrition
of the germ-plasm by the blood of its host, are in reality
precisely the grounds which would lead us to expect
those consequences of parental alcoholism which in fact
we find.</p>

<p><em class="psection">Alcoholism as a symptom of degeneracy.</em>&mdash;We have
seen that alcohol may be a cause of degeneracy: we
now have to recognize the converse relation. For an
authoritative and radical discussion of the problem, the
reader may be referred to the second Norman Kerr
Memorial Lecture, delivered by Dr. Welsh Branthwaite,
H.M. Inspector under the Inebriates' Act, in 1907.<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> He
speaks as “the only man in close touch with all inebriates
under legal detention in England.” He reaches most
important conclusions which are generally accepted, as
the discussion shows. He says, “the more I see of
habitual drunkards, the more I am convinced that the
real condition we have to study, the trouble we have to
fight, and the source of all the mischief, is ... defect<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>
in mental mechanism, generally congenital, sometimes
more or less acquired.... In the absence of alcohol,
the same persons, instead of meriting the term inebriate
would have proved unreliable in many ways; they would
have been called ne'er-do-weels, profligates, persons of
lax morality, excitably or abnormally passionate individuals,
persons of melancholic tendency or eccentric....
It seems to me exceedingly doubtful whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_218" id="p_218">[218]</a></span>
habitual inebriety ... is ever really acquired in the
strictest sense of the word&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> in the absence of some
measure of pre-existing defect.” Having studied 2,277
inebriates, committed under the Inebriates Acts, up
to December 31st, 1906, Dr. Branthwaite <i>finds 62.6
per cent. of these mentally defective</i>. The remainder he
regards as of average mental capacity, using, however,
an exceedingly low standard of what that capacity is.
He concludes that in a large majority of police-court
cases, “mental disease was the condition for which they
were repeatedly imprisoned&mdash;mental disease merely
masked by alcoholic indulgence.... The majority of
our insane inebriates have become alcoholic because of
their tendency to insanity.... Certain peculiarities in
cranial conformation, general physique, and conduct,
have long been recognised as evidences of congenital
defect. Nearly all the 1,375 cases included in the two
defective sections of our table have given evidence of
possessing some of these characteristic peculiarities, and
<i>it is morally certain that the large majority of them started
life handicapped by imperfect brain development</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> The
lecture is accompanied with many photographs clearly
showing the physical marks of congenital defect, and Dr.
Branthwaite remarks that “even the untrained eye
should meet with no difficulty in recognising ‘something
wrong’ with all of them.”</p>

<p>Of the proportion of mentally defective inebriates (62.6
per cent. of the whole) mentioned by Dr. Branthwaite, <i>all</i>
are “practically hopeless from a reformation standpoint.”
This is a sufficient comment, if any were needed, upon
repeated imprisonment for habitual drunkenness&mdash;which,
as Dr. Branthwaite says, “is indefensible and inhumane.”
He adds in closing that, in his judgment, habitual drunkenness,
so far as women are concerned, has materially<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_219" id="p_219">[219]</a></span>
increased, during the last twenty-five years, “which I have
spent entirely amongst drunkards and drunkenness.”
The unfortunate people whom he studies “<i>are not in the
least affected by orthodox temperance efforts; they continue
to propagate drunkenness, and thereby nullify the good results
of temperance energy. Their children, born of defective
parents, and educated by their surroundings, grow up without
a chance of decent life, and constitute the reserve from
which the strength of our present army of habituals is maintained.
Truly we have neglected in the past, and are still
neglecting, the main source of drunkard supply&mdash;the drunkard
himself; cripple that, and we should soon see some good
result from our work.</i>”</p>

<p>A foremost authority, Dr. F. W. Mott, F.R.S., has independently
reached the same conclusion as Dr. Branthwaite&mdash;that
the chronic inebriate comes as a rule of an
inherently tainted stock. (Dr. Mott, however, reminds
us that “if alcohol is a weed killer, preventing the perpetuation
of poor types, it is probably even more effective
as a weed producer.”) Professor David Ferrier, F.R.S.,
the great pioneer of brain localisation, in reference to
these people, speaks of “the risk of propagation of a race
of drunkards and imbeciles.” Dr. J. C. Dunlop, H.M.
Inspector under the Inebriates Act, Scotland, states that
his experience leads him to precisely the same conclusion
as that of Dr. Branthwaite. Dr. A. R. Urquhart, an
asylum authority, affirms that chronic inebriety “is
largely an affair of heredity ... is a symptom of mental
defect, disorder, or disease.” Dr. Fleck, another authority,
says: “It is my strong conviction that a large percentage
of our mentally defective children, including idiots,
imbeciles and epileptics, are the descendants of drunkards.”
Mr. McAdam Eccles, the distinguished surgeon, agrees;
so does Dr. Langdon Down, Physician to the National
Association for the Welfare of the Feeble-minded; so<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_220" id="p_220">[220]</a></span>
does Mr. Thomas Holmes, the Secretary of the Howard
Association, who remarks that “our habitual criminals,
equally with our mental inebriates, are not responsible
beings, but victims of mental disease.” Finally Miss
Kirby, Secretary of the National Association for the
Feeble-minded, insists upon the obvious conclusion that
these people must be detained permanently. She says,
“When one case of a dissolute feeble-minded woman in
America is quoted as the mother of nine feeble-minded
children, we see the cause why inebriate homes, and also
reformatories, penitentiaries, and workhouses are full
to overflowing, and society taxed beyond bearing to keep
them there. <i>Such institutions outnumber homes for the
feeble-minded.</i>”<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> Speaking of the 62.6 per cent. noted by
Dr. Branthwaite, she says, “Would it not have been the
more logical course to have dealt with them in earlier
years?” Now what would that have accomplished?
<i>It would have saved the future.</i></p>

<p><em class="psection">The inebriate as parent.</em>&mdash;Is it a mere supposition that
these women become mothers? Amongst those committed
as criminal inebriates (under the London County
Council) in 1905&ndash;6, three hundred and sixty-five of those
admitted to reformatories had two thousand two hundred
children. These are the official figures. As to the quality
of these children there is unfortunately no possibility of
question.</p>

<p>We may quote from Dr. Sullivan a notable enquiry:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p_221" id="p_221">[221]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot">

<p>“Even more striking results with regard to the several forms
of degeneracy were obtained by Legrain, who investigated the
question from a somewhat different point of view. Selecting
from the material at his disposal all those cases in which
ancestral intemperance had appeared to exercise a causal
influence, and working out their family history, he collected 215
observations of heredo-alcoholism referring to one generation,
98 referring to two generations, and 7 referring to three
generations. Of the children of the first generation, 508 in
number, 196 were mentally degenerate, the affection of the brain
being shown more particularly by moral and emotional abnormality,
while intellectual defects were less pronounced; 106 were
insane, 52 were epileptic, 16 suffered from hystero-epilepsy, and
3 from chorea; and 39 had convulsions in infancy. Amongst
the children of the second generation, who numbered 294, the
intellectual defects were more marked, idiocy, imbecility, or
debility, being noted in the offspring of 54 out of the 98 families
investigated. In 23 out of the 33 families in which the children
of the second generation had reached adult age, one or more
of them were insane. Epilepsy was found in 40 families, infantile
convulsions in 42, and meningitis in 14. The third generation in
7 families was represented by 17 children, all of whom were
weak-minded, imbecile, or idiotic; 2 suffered, moreover, from
moral insanity, 2 from hysteria, and 2 from epilepsy; 3 were
scrofulous, and 4 had convulsions in childhood. In the three
generations taken together there were, in addition to the
children referred to above, 174 infants who were dead-born or
died shortly after birth.”</p></div>

<p>Therefore, the chronic inebriate must not become a
parent. Let it be said that these people are wicked or
have no self-control, drink for fun or love of degradation,
then become drunkards, and prejudicially affect their
children. The conclusion is the same. Have any theory
of heredity you please&mdash;Lamarckianism, Darwin's pangenesis,
Weismannism, Mendelism; it matters not a
straw. Look at the thing from the uncharitable religious
point of view, or from the charitable scientific view which
realizes, in the case of these women, that to know all
is to pardon all&mdash;the conclusion is still the same.</p>

<p><em class="psection">The present scandal of London's inebriates.</em>&mdash;This,
then, being so, abundance of official evidence having been
gathered in addition to all the unofficial evidence, let us
consider the shameful facts which are in process as I write,
and are still so, on revision of these pages a year later.<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_222" id="p_222">[222]</a></span>
They are outlined in the reply of Mr. Herbert Gladstone,
the Home Secretary, to a question in the House of Commons.
The reply is printed in full in <i>The Times</i>, Feb.
19th, 1908. There was a paltry squabble between the
Government and the London County Council as to the
exact number of shillings that each was to contribute per
week for the maintenance of inebriates. The London
County Council was plainly in the wrong, its ignorance
being sufficiently indicated by the letter to <i>The Times</i>,
which I will quote. The result of the squabble is that,
as Mr. G. R. Sims said, “We shall have something like five
hundred women, all habitual drunkards, passing in and out
of the prisons, a peril to publicans, a pest to the police,
an evil example to the women with whom they mix,
and free to bring children into the world, their little
lives poisoned at the source.” We have therefore
reverted to the shameful, brutal, and disastrous system
sufficiently indicated by the history of Jane Cakebread,
at whom, when one was a schoolboy as ignorant as
those who now govern us, one used to laugh because
she had been convicted so many hundreds of times.<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>
As the present writer said in raising the matter at a
meeting of the Eugenics Education Society, the future
children of these women are not only doomed by the very
nature of their germ-plasm, but they will actually be many
times intoxicated not merely in their cradles but before
their birth. There is no wealth but life, and this future
wealth of England is to be fed on poisoned food and many
times made drunken before it sees the light. The meeting
of the Society passed a unanimous resolution&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_223" id="p_223">[223]</a></span>“That
this society enters a protest against the present administration
of the Inebriates Act, whereby through the closing
of inebriate homes some hundreds of chronic inebriate
women will be set adrift in London, with an inevitably
deteriorating result to the race.”<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>For this particular scandal the London County Council
was the more to blame. Let not the reader suppose
that a Liberal Government, however, was likely to
remedy the immoderate ignorance of a “Moderate”
County Council on this matter. Mr. Gladstone's reply
in Parliament was an exceptionally long one, but it
did not contain a syllable to suggest that any question
of the future is involved, or that a woman may become
a mother. Further, the Licensing Bill introduced just
when we were drawing public attention to this scandal
contained nowhere any hint of the principle that you
must attack drunkenness by attacking “the main source
of drunkard supply&mdash;the drunkard himself.” These, the
reader will remember, are the words of His Majesty's
Inspector. There is no question of party-feeling, then,
the reader will understand, in what has here been said.
Whether labelled Liberal, Conservative, Progressive or
Moderate, ignorance is still ignorance, and when in action
is still what Goethe called it, the most dangerous thing
in the world.</p>

<p>Pure ignorance, of course, is one of the things against
which the advocate of race-culture must fight. The
lack of imagination, however, is another. At present
we have few homes for the feeble-minded, and many for
what the feeble-minded become: few for prevention,
which is possible and cheap, many for cure, which is
impossible and dear. The average county councillor or
politician, of course, is rather more short-sighted than
the average man, simply because you cannot be far-sighted
and a partisan. What his defect of vision requires
is impossible, but it would be effective. It is that
the consequences of unworthy parenthood should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_224" id="p_224">[224]</a></span>
immediate, instead of taking months or years to develop.
Any one, even a politician, can see cause and effect when
they are close enough together. It is the little interval
that the political eye cannot pierce. Nevertheless, we
shall one day learn to think of the next generation, and
then there will be an end of the politician who thinks
only of the next election.</p>

<p><em class="psection">Ignorance on its defence.</em>&mdash;The state of what has no
excuse for being uninformed opinion was only too well illustrated
in a letter from the Chairman of the Public Control
Committee of the London County Council which appeared
in <i>The Times</i> for Feb. 27th, 1908. In defending the London
County Council the writer used the following words:
“Reformation, not mere detention, was its object when
it instituted its reformatory under the Inebriates Acts....
The case of the Public Control Committee is that
the removal and detention of the hopeless habituals is a
matter for the police.” The explanation aggravates the
offence. In the face of reiterated expert opinion, which
has no dissentient, as to the practical impossibility of
reformation&mdash;you cannot <i>re</i>form what has never been
formed, viz., a normally developed brain&mdash;here we find
a man in this responsible position, a man who has the
power to put his ignorance into action, telling us that the
London County Council aims at the impossible in this
respect; whilst, in utter defiance of the future and of the
useless brutality of the police-court method, he tells us
that these “hopeless habituals” are a matter for the
police. Then, by way of making the thing complete, he
speaks of “mere detention.” What he calls “mere detention”
is everything, for it saves the future by preventing
parenthood on the part of members of the community who,
more certainly than any others that can be named, are
unworthy of it. The adjective “mere” is only too
adequate a measure of the state of opinion which, by such<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_225" id="p_225">[225]</a></span>
retrograde courses as that under discussion, promises to
destroy the British people ere long&mdash;and therefore, of
course, the Empire of which that people is the living and
necessary foundation.</p>

<p>It may be noted in passing that the word “reformatory,”
employed in the Inebriates Act of 1898, is a highly
unfortunate one. It suggests a practically impossible
hope, and it ignores what, I submit, must and will ere
long be regarded as the essential purpose, function and
value of the detention of inebriates&mdash;the prohibition of
parenthood on their part. In the case of women beyond
the child-bearing age, the whole case is radically altered.
If it amuses the legislature to cherish fantastic hopes, let
it speak about the reformation of these women. If it
prefers the futile and disgusting cruelty of the Jane Cakebread
method for such women, when the plan for reformation
is found to fail, that is no affair of ours in the present
volume. Such women have been in effect sterilised by
natural processes, and the advocate of race-culture can
afford to ignore them, for they do not concern him. Let
me note, however, that, of 294 female inebriates
admitted to reformatories in the year 1906, 170 were
under forty years of age, 92, of whom a considerable
proportion would be possible mothers, were between
forty and fifty, and only 32 of the total were over
fifty years of age.<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> It may be said that the lives
of these unhappy women tend to be terminated early.
The only pity is that our present blindness and
ignorance in dealing with them are not neutralised,
so far as the future is concerned, by death at much
earlier ages. If such a reflection strikes the reader
as cruel, how much more cruel are those who are
responsible for the present case of the women inebriates
of London?</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p_226" id="p_226">[226]</a></span></p>
<p>The <i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>, on March 4th, 1908, gave the
utmost prominence to an article of mine on this subject,
entitled “An Urgent Public Scandal, The Case of London's
Inebriates.” In this article I quoted <i>The Times</i> letter
referred to above, and levelled the most vigorous indictment
I could against the authors of the outrage under
discussion. None of them ventured to reply. In the
<i>Referee</i> for March 8th, 1908, however, a member of the
Public Control Committee of the London County Council
made an attempt to defend its action. The curious reader
may refer to that letter as one more instance of that
absolute blindness to the nature of the problem and to
any question of the future which had already been
indicated in <i>The Times</i> letter from the Chairman of
the Committee. Taking these two letters together,
we may say that never has a public outrage committed
by men in authority been more lamely or ignorantly
defended.</p>

<p><em class="psection">Ignorance in action&mdash;the present facts.</em>&mdash;Since the
beginning of January, 1908, the brutal course decreed
by the London County Council has been pursued. The
wretched and deeply-to-be-pitied women have been
and are being discharged at the rate of some twenty to
twenty-five per month as their terms expire. The wiser
sort of magistrates and the police-court missionaries are
at their wits' ends, and no wonder. This country offers
these women at the moment no refuge whatever; nothing
but the degrading and destructive round&mdash;police-court,
prison, public-house, pavement; <i>da capo</i>. Writing to <i>The
Times</i> in relation to the correspondence there published
(April 18th, 1908) between the London County Council
and the Eugenics Education Society, Sir Alfred Reynolds,
Chairman of the State Inebriate Reformatory Visiting
Board and a Visiting Justice of Holloway Prison, said
(April 21st, 1908):&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p_227" id="p_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The correspondence published in <i>The Times</i> of April 18,
between the London County Council and the President of the
Eugenics Education Society convinces me more than ever that
the dispute between the London County Council and the
Treasury is a scandal and folly of the worst description. For
the sake of 6d. per case per day, the London County Council
(the same body which receives half a million sterling from the
sale of intoxicating liquor) has made it impossible for the metropolitan
magistrates to carry out the Act of 1898, and the result
is that 500 of the worst female inebriates are alternately on
the streets or in prison again, and the former scenes of horror
and drunken violence reappear. Holloway Prison will soon
fill up again, and all the good which has been done during
the last few years will be lost.... I will not trouble you
further, except by emphasising what I have said by adding
that since January last year 1,500 women have been notified
to Scotland Yard as always in and out of prison from the
County of London, are qualified for inebriate homes, and at
the present moment there are over 50 of this number in Holloway
Prison serving absolutely useless short terms of imprisonment.”</p></div>

<p><em class="psection">The London County Council performs a service for
philosophy.</em>&mdash;As we have seen, there exists or seems to
exist a radical antagonism in certain groups of cases
between the interests of the individual and the interests
of the race. You may preserve the quality of the race, as
the Spartans did, by exposing defective infants; you may
be kind to feeble-minded children, as we are, but you will
injure the race in the long run. Darwin saw this more than
a generation ago, but instead of suggesting the prohibition
of parenthood to the unfit, he said that we must bear the
ill effects of their multiplication rather than sacrifice the
law of love. Huxley similarly said that moral evolution
consisted in opposing natural evolution. Now it has for
some time been evident that this antagonism need not be
radical if, whilst devoting hospitals and charity and
medical science to the care of the unfit, we deny them the
privilege of parenthood. On the other hand, the London<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_228" id="p_228">[228]</a></span>
County Council by its present action has performed a
service to biological philosophy by showing that <i>it is
possible to combine the maximum of brutality to the individual
and to the present with the maximum of injury to the race
and to the future</i>. In his report for 1906 Dr. Branthwaite
cites the history of a girl who, at the age of fifteen years and
nine months, was convicted in 1881 for being drunk and
disorderly. During the next quarter of a century she was
sentenced 115 times, and in January, 1906, was sent to a
reformatory. She has twice attempted to commit
suicide. Her case is, of course, now hopeless, and Dr.
Branthwaite predicts that her life will end by suicide.
Let any one read Dr. Branthwaite's Report or Dr. Robert
Jones's account of Jane Cakebread, or let him acquaint
himself with instances as they are to be daily seen, and
he will agree that the maximum of brutality is no excessive
phrase to describe the policy of shame at present pursued
in London: if, indeed, seeing that we now have
knowledge, it should not be described as something still
worse.</p>

<p>As for the injury to the future, we already know what
the present policy effects. We may grant, then, to the
London County Council that it has performed a service
for philosophy in showing that it is possible to combine
both kinds of evil in one harmonious policy. Nor let
the reader suppose that any partisan feeling infects this
protest. The Government is also to blame. Even had
the L.C.C. declined to contribute anything at all to the
cost of the proper policy, no really educated and honourable
Government had any choice but to undertake all
the cost itself&mdash;even at the cost of office! Better were&mdash;in
Mr. Balfour's words, the wisest he ever uttered&mdash;“the
barren exchange of one set of tyrants, or jobbers, for
another,” than the horrible birth of thousands of feeble-minded
babies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p_229" id="p_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p><em class="psection">The argument from economy.</em>&mdash;It would be easy to
show that the present policy is not economical even as
regards the cost of these women themselves, and even
if it be assumed that gold is wealth. But consider the
remoter cost. During the period when the present writer
was making public protests very nearly every day on
this matter without any immediate effect, and only one
month after the London County Council had attempted
to defend itself on the ground of economy when
challenged by the Eugenics Education Society, there
was formally opened, with a flourish of trumpets, the
eighty-seventh school for feeble-minded children established
by the London County Council. It accommodates
sixty such children (besides sixty physically defective).
This school cost £6,000 to build alone. The sixty feeble-minded
children whom it accommodates are not a very
large proportion of the 7,000 admittedly feeble-minded
school children in London&mdash;a number which is probably
not more than a third or a fourth of the real number. It
has been exhaustively proved that feeble-minded children
are mainly, at any given time, the progeny of feeble-minded
persons such as constitute the majority of chronic
inebriates. Ignorance is again in action. On the one
hand, the London County Council, quarrelling over
pence, effectively suspends the working of the Inebriates
Acts, and thus ensures that the supply of feeble-minded
children shall be kept up. On the other hand, it takes
these children, cares for them until they are capable of
becoming parents, and then turns them upon the world.
The Chairman at the opening ceremony of the school
referred to said that “at the special schools work was
being done which would advance the intelligence of
the pupils, and thus benefit the entire race.” It would
be difficult to concentrate more ignorance in fewer words
or in ten times as many.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p_230" id="p_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p><em class="psection">A Home Office Committee appointed.</em>&mdash;The almost
continuous protest of two months did, however, bear
fruit, the Home Secretary appointing a Committee to
consider the question of the amendment of the Inebriates
Acts. But the legal brutalities described are still being
perpetrated, and the future is being compromised.
The London County Council may be advised to make
arrangements for building a few score more schools for
defective children in anticipation of the growing need
which it is assuring.</p>

<p>Never again, when it is past, must we permit the
present abominable policy. It is for public opinion to
effect this, and public opinion has only to be directed
to the case in order to realise its nature. If the reader
pleases he may discount altogether the eugenic argument,
though I believe that in the long run that is more
important than any other. But if he confines his
attention solely to the cruelties perpetrated upon these
helpless women, infinitely more sinned against than
sinning, and especially if he considers the testimony
of Sir Alfred Reynolds above quoted, he will surely
lend his aid to put an end to a state of affairs which
is a disgrace to our civilisation. We talk of progress,
and we are indeed incalculably indebted to our ancestors,
but let any one consider the case of the poor child, now
a wrecked woman, quoted above, and let him consider what
it may be to be an heir of all the ages in the greatest
city of the world to-day.</p>

<p>It will be sufficiently evident that if any warrant were
needed for the formation of the Eugenics Education
Society or for the publication of the present volume,
it would be found only too abundantly in the outrage upon
decency and morality and science and the future which
is at present in perpetration. Further, if any warrant were
required for the incessant reiteration of the principle<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_231" id="p_231">[231]</a></span>
that there is no wealth but life, it would be found in the
fact that this outrage is being committed in the name
of economy. Yet even if the sane and sober London
ratepayer were saved a few shillings now, as he will not
be, his children will have to pay pounds in the future
for the support of these women's children. Economy,
forsooth, when the rates of London benefited to the
extent of £559,000 out of the sale of intoxicating liquors
in 1905, and spent £8,000 in the maintenance of committed
inebriates! Need one apologise for declaring
again, that we require a new political economy which
teaches that gold is for the purchase of life, and not
life for the purchase of gold. For the public outrage
under discussion, whereby an untold measure of life,
present and to come, “breathing and to be,” is to
be destroyed and defiled for a squabble over shillings,
one can adequately quote only the words of Romeo
to the apothecary: “There is thy gold; worse poison
to men's souls, doing more murders in this loathsome
world, than those poor compounds that thou may'st
not sell.”</p>

<p><em class="psection">The last touches of art.</em>&mdash;If this protest hurts any one's
feelings, that cannot be helped. When the production
of thousands of feeble-minded children is involved,
the self-esteem of what Mr. George Meredith
calls the “accepted imbecile” does not matter. The
question is, How soon do we propose to rectify our present
course in this respect?&mdash;a course which is a shame and a
disgrace to our age and nation, and which shall in any
case be placed on record in printed words, as well as in
young children stamped with degeneracy&mdash;in order to
point for future ages the question “<i>An nescis, mi fili,
quantilla prudentia regitur orbis?</i>” “With how little
wisdom”&mdash;and, whilst perpetrating this shame, ignoring
the <i>one</i> indisputable means by which legislation can and<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_232" id="p_232">[232]</a></span>
must check drunkenness, nearly all other measures having
failed since Babylon was an Empire, they were quarrelling
about a temperance measure, so-called, which regarded
the question of transference of money from one pocket
to another as vital, and ignored the one vital question,
which is the question of life: a measure showing scarcely
a sign, either in its text or in the words of its supporters
or in the words of its opponents, that the question of
the future race had ever entered into the head of a
public man; a measure which left the protection of
children from the public-house to the discretion of local
magistrates; a measure which certainly, whatever else
it might effect, could not have been more carefully drawn
if its object were to promote that secret drinking amongst
women<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> which means the poisoning of the racial life
even before it sees the light. This, then, “<i>mi fili</i>,” was
what was called practical statesmanship in the year
1908 of the Christian Era: and in order that no last
touch might be wanted from the hand of ignorance
and the blasphemous idolatry which worships gold to
the neglect of the only true god, which is life, they
announced just at this time the issue of a Royal Commission
to enquire and report upon the manufacture
and variations in the composition of whiskey. It has
been a public joke for years past that no one can answer
the question, “What is whiskey?” Well, then, I will
answer the question, and we may save the labour of
such commissions hereafter. Whiskey is a <i>racial poison</i>,
and there is nothing else to know about it worth knowing
<i>for the future</i>. Those who will never become, or can
no longer become, fathers or mothers, may do as they
please about whiskey, so far as the ideal of eugenics or
race-culture is concerned. They may say, if they like,<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_233" id="p_233">[233]</a></span>
that their personal habits are their affair and concern
no one else. Under the influence of whiskey they may,
perhaps, even believe this. But for those who are to
be the fathers and mothers of the future, such a plea is
idle. The question is not solely their affair; it is the
affair of the unborn, and we who champion the unborn
are bound to say so.</p>

<p>The time will come when it is recognised that there
are two classes of active mind in society: those who
worship and uphold the past, and will always sacrifice
the living to the dead, nay more, the unborn to the
dead. The ultimate fate of these is the fate of her who
looked backwards to the shame and destruction from
which she had escaped. She was turned into a pillar
of salt. And there are those who worship and work
for the future, who will, without hesitation, sacrifice
the interests of the dead (who are no longer interested)
to those of the living and the coming race&mdash;nay, more,
who will even sacrifice the interests of a few worthless
living to those of many yet unborn, <i>that they may be
worthy</i>. Let the dead bury their dead; let the worshippers
of the dead and the dying ask themselves whether the
life that is and the life that is to be do not demand their
homage and service. Not until some such principles as
these are recognised shall we rightly deal with the drink
problem, amongst many others, and bring to it the mental
and moral enlightenment which makes for life on the higher
plane, just as surely and just as indispensably as the
light of the sun creates all life whatsoever.</p>

<p><em class="psection">Mr. Balfour on legislation.</em>&mdash;Surely the moral of this
argument is clear. The most important, the most
radical, the most practicable of all temperance measures
is that which attacks the main source of supply of the
drunkard. When a Licensing Bill is brought before the
House of Commons, Mr. Balfour repeats the ancient piece<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_234" id="p_234">[234]</a></span>
of nonsense that you cannot make people moral by Act
of Parliament&mdash;an assertion that any child can see to
be a muddle. We may let that pass for the moment,
but Mr. Balfour is a thinker, a student of biology, and
heredity in especial, and he has lately been lecturing
on “Decadence.” Might it not have been expected that
such a man would take an opportunity to say what the
humblest serious student of the subject would have said,
and thereby to bring far more damaging criticism against
the opposing party's bill than any he hinted at? He
might have said, “Your bill, even if passed, will accomplish
little, or relatively little, at great cost, because you
have no grasp of the principles of the subject. You
have no idea of what drunkenness really is. If your bill
were worth a straw it would seek as a primary principle
to safeguard the race by arresting the supply of potential
drunkards. Your endless financial clauses deal merely
with the re-distribution of money, but your bill has no
clause that deals with the only business of governments,
the creation and the economy of the only real wealth,
which is human life.” That is what the ex-Premier did
not say. He had plenty of passion, plenty of party-feeling
to give fire to his words, but so far as knowledge
is concerned or any conception of what alone is the
wealth of nations, there was nothing to choose between
Mr. Balfour and Mr. Asquith. Passion you must have
if you are to do anything, but not party-passion: whereas
if you have passion for life and for children, not only will
it be effective, but, notwithstanding all that the psychologists
tell us as to the vitiation of judgment by emotion,
it will actually teach you the supreme and eternal truths.</p>

<p>In this book hitherto little has been said as to formal
eugenic legislation. I believe with Etienne that it is
opinion which governs the world: legislation in front
of public opinion brings all law into contempt. But in<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_235" id="p_235">[235]</a></span>
his first speech opposing the Licensing Bill of 1908, Mr.
Balfour, the author of the Licensing Bill of 1904, decried
legislation. “Intemperance,” he said, “is a vice”:
and legislation can do practically nothing in dealing with
a vice. Plainly Mr. Balfour is ignorant of the nature
of intemperance, which largely depends upon transmitted
and inherent brain defect. He therefore lost his opportunity
of pointing out in what fashion you <i>can</i> actually,
notwithstanding the parrots, make people sober by
Act of Parliament&mdash;viz., by forbidding parenthood to
those whose children would almost certainly become
drunkards. We who are not politicians, much less
ex-Premiers, must make our own proposals then. Last
year's criticism of the London County Council began, I
believe, to educate public opinion to the necessary point.
In the name of race-culture and the New Patriotism,
in the name of morality and charity and science, we
must demand, obtain and carry into effect the most
stringent and comprehensive legislation, such as effectively
to forbid parenthood on the part of the chronic inebriate.
Ere long, the person who would have become a chronic
inebriate will be cared for and protected during childhood
and thereafter,&mdash;with the same result. This solution of
the problem is denounced, says Dr. Archdall Reid,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p_236" id="p_236">[236]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot">

<p>“... as horrible, as Malthusian, as immoral, as impracticable....
The alternative is more horrible and more immoral still.
If by any means we save the inebriates of this generation, but
permit them to have offspring, future generations must deal
with an increased number of inebriates.... The experience of
many centuries has rendered it sufficiently plain, that while
there is drink, there will be drunkards till the race be purged
of them. We have therefore no real choice between Temperance
Reform by the abolition of drink, and Temperance Reform by
the elimination of the drunkard.... Which is the worse; that
miserable drunkards shall bear wretched children to a fate of
starvation and neglect and early death, or of subsequent
drunkenness and crime, or that, by our deliberate act, the
procreation of children shall be forbidden them? We are on
the horns of a dilemma from which there is no escape.... But
our time has seen the labours of Darwin. We know now the
great secret. Science has given us knowledge and with it
power. We have learnt that if we labour for the individual
alone, we shall surely fail; but that if we make our sacrifice
greater, if we labour for the race as well, we must succeed.
Let us then by all means seek to save the individual drunkard;
with all our power let us endeavour to make and keep him
sober; but let us strive also to eradicate the type; for, as I
have said, if we do it not quickly and with mercy, Nature will
do it slowly and with infinite cruelty.”</p></div>

<p><em class="psection">Women and children first.</em>&mdash;The noble cry on a sinking
ship is “women and children first.” This perhaps is
a plea for the service of helplessness as such, though it
might be equally warranted as a demand for the sacrifice
of the present to the future. And assuredly the cry
for a sinking society must also be “women and children
first.” It is well if the cry be raised when the ship of
state is not yet sinking, but only water-logged or alcohol-logged.
Temperance legislation and the agitation for
temperance reform are themselves in need of reform.
Their appalling record of failure&mdash;for it is such a record&mdash;should
help even the fanatic, one thinks, to accept
the introduction of the eugenic idea as a new principle of
life for the temperance cause. In the present state of
custom and opinion, the teetotaler cannot force his own
wise habits upon the vast majority who do not agree with
him. If he has an infinite amount of energy and resources,
let him spend as much of both as he pleases upon the
sort of propaganda with which we are familiar: he
will, by the hypothesis, still have an infinite amount
of both available for the cause to which the principle
of race-culture would direct him. If, however, his
energy and resources are finite,&mdash;if, indeed, they are by<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_237" id="p_237">[237]</a></span>
no means excessive in proportion to the urgent task
which the ideal of race-culture asks of him, then let him
not fritter away a moment or a penny or a breath until
he has achieved the process of salvage or salvation which
is expressed in the phrase “women and children first.”
More accurately, perhaps, our cry must be “parents
and possible parents first,” and this for present practical
purposes is equivalent to “women and children first.”</p>

<p>It would have been well if the temperance propaganda
from the first, say two generations ago in Great Britain,
had adopted this motto. But its adoption is far more
urgent to-day in consequence of the fact, unfortunately
no longer to be questioned, that drinking amongst women,
the mothers of the future, is, and has been for some time,
steadily increasing. Children yet unborn must be protected
from the injury which may be inflicted upon them
by those who will be their mothers. Yet though there
is more need for action in this regard than ever before,
and though Mr. G. R. Sims in his books <i>The Cry of the
Children</i> and <i>The Black Stain</i> has lately drawn wide
attention to the subject, we have seen that the principle
of women and children first, a principle derived from
the ideal of race-culture, and directly serving that ideal,
was almost wholly ignored in the Licensing Bill of
1908. The motto “Money, not motherhood,” is a bad
one for the framers of a temperance measure. If ever we
have a temperance measure worthy the name the
motto of its framers will be “Motherhood, not money.”
Such a measure will most certainly have to introduce
the principle of indeterminate sentences&mdash;or rather,
indeterminate <i>care</i>&mdash;in the treatment of the chronic
inebriate. There is no possibility of two opinions as to
the urgent and indispensable necessity of such treatment,
nor yet as to its scrupulous humanity both for the unfortunate
victim himself or herself and for the unborn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p_238" id="p_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>The word “reformatory” had better be abolished from
official language, since it leads accredited people to write
to <i>The Times</i> such foolishness as “reformation, not mere
detention.”</p>

<p>Further, the expense of dealing with the chronic
inebriate in this, the only humane and economical way,
had better fall entirely and directly upon the state. It
must not be possible again for a local authority, even the
London County Council, however ignorant or criminally
careless, to commit a public indecency like that already
recorded&mdash;but the full record of which none of us will live
to see.</p>

<p><em class="psection">An unpunished magistrate.</em>&mdash;Yet again, in this measure
there must be some means of compelling such magistrates
as cannot be educated. At present, even when accommodation
is provided, the unfortunate creature of the
Jane Cakebread type, when she is only just beginning
to enter into competition with that horrible record, and
when she is therefore most dangerous as regards the
possibility of motherhood, can be detained only by the
magistrate's order. Now it is very much less trouble
for all concerned to say “five shillings or a week” than
to make the necessary enquiries in such cases. Further,
in putting this measure of one's dreams upon the statute
book, we shall have to remember that the idea of protective
care and the eugenic idea are, to say the least,
not native in the mind of every magistrate. In Dr.
Welsh Branthwaite's report for 1906, there is quoted a
case where a woman had been habitually drunken for
at least thirteen years previous to her committal to
a reformatory. Her known sentences included 27
fines, and 138 terms of imprisonment. She was feeble-minded.
On the termination of her reformatory sentence
the discharge certificate described her as “quite unfit to
control her own actions,” and <span class="pagenum"><a name="p_239" id="p_239">[239]</a></span>“certain to succumb to
the first temptation to drink.” The woman was found
drunk a few hours after discharge. Said the magistrate,
“this case clearly proves that it is almost useless trying
to reform such women as this.... I think, after all,
the old way is best and therefore I sentence her to one
month with hard labour.” I refrain from suggesting a
suitable sentence for the magistrate: doubtless he got
off scot-free.</p>

<p>Surely we might agree, as regards this racial poison,
that at least parenthood and the future must be kept out
of its clutches. It may be, it assuredly is, a deplorable
thing that the woman of fifty, to take an instance, should
become alcoholic, but at the worst this is only the fate of
an individual&mdash;in the main at any rate. Such principles
as these will some day be the cardinal principles of legislation,
and not only in regard to alcohol. The time will
and must come when public opinion will urge, whether
in the name of a New Imperialism or of common morality
or of self-protection, that in our attempts to deal with
alcohol we shall begin by removing its fingers from the
throat of the race: “Women and children first.”</p>

<p><em class="psection">The Report of the Inebriates Committee.</em>&mdash;In January,
1909, the Committee which was at last appointed
to consider this matter made its Report.<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> I have
not the literary capacity to comment adequately upon
the political wisdom which brings in a Licensing Bill,
devotes vast labour and much time to it and has it
rejected by the House of Lords, while such a Committee
as this is at work. The spirit of the politician who
spoke of “those damned professors” still reigns over us,
and will certainly ruin us unless speedily deposed. However,
here is the Report, and its recommendations are
earnestly to be commended to the study of all students.
New legislation, as it shows, is urgently required, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_240" id="p_240">[240]</a></span>
it is pre-eminently the duty of every eugenist to hasten
its coming. This is not a party question, but merely a
national one, and will therefore be dealt with by politicians
only under external pressure, such as produced
the Committee itself. The finger of public opinion must
apply that pressure forthwith.</p>

<p>The recommendations of the Committee are so admirable
and thorough and eugenic in effect as to temper
one's disappointment that the Report contains no
definite, overt recognition of the eugenic idea. I had
hoped that the evidence prepared and submitted to the
Committee for the Eugenics Education Society would
suffice to ensure the recognition of the eugenic idea in
the Report, for the first time, we may suppose, in official
history. For the present we may merely note that the
suggestions made in preceding pages are confirmed by
the Committee's Report, and that the next legislation
bearing on the question of temperance will undoubtedly
have to attack the subject in this radical manner&mdash;by
what will be in effect the sterilisation of the habitual
drinker of either sex and any social status. The Committee
do not recognise that that is what their Report
involves, much less that that gives it its real value;
but so it is, as the year 1950 will be late enough to show.</p>

<p>Much time and trouble were spent in preparing for the
Eugenics Education Society answers to many of the
questions submitted to it by the Committee, and the
Society may fairly claim, I think, that its original services
to this matter were well-continued. The present writer
also prepared for the Society a Memorandum (Minutes of
Evidence, p. 189), which perhaps fairly sums up, in the
briefest possible space, the indisputable relations between
alcohol and parenthood, and which may therefore be
reprinted here. The reader will notice an omission in
that nothing is said as to the effects of alcohol in injuring<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_241" id="p_241">[241]</a></span>
the germ-cells of healthy stock of either sex. The
omission was made in order that nothing possibly disputable
might be included. It has already been argued
that on grounds both of fact and of theory there is every
reason to recognise in alcohol, as in syphilis and in lead,
a racial poison, originating racial degeneration which,
in accordance with generally recognised principles, shows
itself in the latest, highest and therefore most delicate
portions of the organism.</p>

<p>The Memorandum is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>“It may be pointed out that the children of the
drunkard are on the average less capable of citizenship
on account of</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“(a) The inheritance of nervous defect inherent in the
parent.</p>

<p>“(b) Intra-uterine alcoholic poisoning in cases where
the mother is an inebriate.</p>

<p>“(c) Neglect, ill-feeding, accidents, blows, etc., which
are responsible on the one hand for much infant
mortality, and combined with the possible
causes before mentioned, for the ultimate production
of adults defective both in body and
mind.</p></div>

<p>“It would appear, then, that the drunkard, if not
effectively restrained, conduces to the production of a
defective race, involving a grave financial burden upon
the sober portion of the community, to say nothing of
higher considerations. It therefore seems to the Eugenics
Education Society of extreme importance that some
substantial effort should be made for the reform of
existing drunkards, or the permanent control of the
irreformable.</p>

<p>“Scientific warrant for the foregoing propositions is
now to be found in no small abundance. Reference may
be made, for instance, to the chapter on<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_242" id="p_242">[242]</a></span> ‘Alcoholism and
Human Degeneration,’ in Dr. W. C. Sullivan's recent
work <i>Alcoholism</i> (Nisbet, 1906). Dr. Sullivan quotes the
results of more than a dozen observers in this and other
countries, and special attention may be drawn to his
own well-known study of the history of 600 children
born of 120 drunken mothers. The works of Professor
Forel of Zurich are widely known in this connection,
notably <i>Die Sexuel Frage</i>, and <i>The Hygiene of Nerves and
Mind</i> (Translation, Murray, 1907). Parental alcoholism
as a true cause of epilepsy in the offspring is now generally
recognised. For numerous and detailed proofs from
many sources reference may be made to page 210 of the
last work named.</p>

<p>“It is not necessary, however, to go over the ground
which has doubtless been covered by the Royal Commission
on the Care and Control of the Feeble-minded.</p>

<p>“The existing laws comply to only a very small and
almost negligible extent with the eugenic requirement.
They only deal with (a) the very minute proportion of
inebriates who can be induced to voluntarily sign away
their liberty, and (b) those who are also criminal or all
but hopeless and who have done harm already, either
as individuals or in becoming parents. The third group
of inebriates (c) not included in (a) or (b) constitutes
the overwhelming majority of the whole. They are
absolutely untouched by the present law, and further
powers are urgently required to deal with them.</p>

<p>“Such legislation would be by no means without precedent,
and may avail itself of the experience of several
of our own colonies and various foreign countries. Such
methods as compulsory control on petition, guardianship
and so forth are in employment, for instance, in the
Australian Commonwealth and New Zealand, California,
Connecticut, Massachusetts, various cantons in Switzerland,
Nova Scotia, etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p_243" id="p_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>“To sum up, the Society advocates the retention of the
present law so far as classes (a) and (b) are concerned,
but would most strongly urge the addition of powers to
deal with that great majority of inebriates whom the
present law does not touch.”</p>

<p><em class="psection">The friends of alcohol.</em>&mdash;Those who defend the alcoholic
poisoning of the race may be easily classified. Some
few honestly stand for liberty. Like Archbishop Magee,
they would rather see England free than England sober,
not asking in what sense England drunken could be
called free. Some are merely irritated by the temperance
fanatic. Many fear that their personal comfort may be
interfered with. But probably the overwhelming majority
are concerned with their pockets. They live by this
cannibal trade; by selling death and the slaughter of
babies, feeble-mindedness and insanity, consumption and
worse diseases, crime and pauperism, degradation of body
and mind in a thousand forms, to the present generation
and therefore to the future, the unconsulted party to the
bargain. Their motto is “Your money and your life.”
So powerful are they that most of them are frank. They
form associations for their defence, and hold mass meetings
at which they condemn any temperance measure that is
before the country, “whilst ready to welcome any real
temperance reform.” They demand adequate compensation:
though, if they disgorged every farthing they
possess, and devoted themselves body and soul for the
rest of their lives to the human cause, they could never
compensate us who are alive, let alone the dead or the
unborn, for the human ruin on which they build their
success. They build their palaces before our eyes; one
of the largest and newest, not far from Piccadilly Circus,
I often pass; but where most see only fine stone, the
student of infant mortality, the lover of children, he who<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_244" id="p_244">[244]</a></span>
works and looks for the life of this world to come, sees the
bodies of the children of men and is tempted to recall the
curse of Joshua, “He shall lay the foundation thereof
in his firstborn, and in his youngest son shall he set up
the gates of it.”</p>

<p><em class="psection">Alcoholic Imperialism.</em>&mdash;At least let the alcoholic
party refrain from calling themselves Imperialists.
Amongst them, for instance, is the “Imperial bard,” the
“poet of empire,” he who has appealed to the “god of
our fathers,” and who warns us lest it shall be said that
“all our pomp of yesterday is one with Nineveh and
Tyre”: and appeals to deity&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Judge of the Nations, spare us yet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest we forget, lest we forget!”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This prophet of what some may think a blasphemous
Imperialism gives his name to the association which
frankly in this matter of alcohol stands for gold as against
life. We are to beware lest “drunk with sight of power”
we boast as do the “lesser breeds” to whom the “awful
Hand” of God has not granted dominion: nor are we
to put our trust in reeking tube and iron shard. We
may freely call ourselves Imperialists, however, even
though we should be numbered amongst those whom
Ruskin, himself the son of a wine merchant, called the
“vendors of death.” One wonders whether the “Lord
God” exists that he can withhold his “awful Hand” at
such a spectacle as this. If some amongst us are to win
gold by the sale of this racial poison, and if it must be so,
let them at least be consistent, and label themselves <i>the
very littlest of little Englanders</i>, which they are. An
alcoholic Imperialism is of the kind which no Empire
can long survive.</p>

<p>Those of us whom such things as these make sick, and
who yet, with true poets like Wordsworth, are proud of<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_245" id="p_245">[245]</a></span>
“the tongue that Shakespeare spake,” and who with him
declare:&mdash;</p>

<p>&mdash;those of us who know that the foundations of any

everything is worth while,” may wonder what process
has been afoot that in three generations English poetry
should pass from the sonnets of Wordsworth to “Duke's
son, cook's son,” etc.; and may even at times, especially
those of us who know what alcohol costs in life, feel a
momentary recession of our faith that Great Britain need
not now be writing the last page of her great history.

the press concerning alcohol. We see the cannibal cause
of beer and spirits, which makes many widows and

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV</a><br />
<small>THE RACIAL POISONS: LEAD, NARCOTICS, SYPHILIS</small></h3>


<p>The term racial poisons teaches us to distinguish, amongst
substances known to be poisonous to the individual,
those which injure the germ-plasm: and amongst
substances poisonous to the expectant mother herself,
we must distinguish those which may also poison her
unborn child. Alcohol is pre-eminently <i>the</i> racial poison,
thus defined, and I plead for its recognition as primarily
a racial poison, this being immeasurably the most important
aspect of the whole alcohol question. Readers of
Professor Forel will not lightly question this assertion.</p>

<p>The total number of racial poisons is, of course, very
large. Amongst them must theoretically be included all
abortifacient drugs. There are also various poisons
of disease to be included in this category. Later
pages must be devoted to what is by far the most
important of these. But we may observe in passing that
such a disease as rheumatic fever or acute rheumatism
has especial significance for the student of race-culture
since, as he knows, its poisons circulating in the blood of
an expectant mother may not only injure her own heart
for life but may pass through the placenta and deform
the valves of the child's heart, with the subsequent result
loosely described as “congenital heart disease.” The
conditions giving rise to rheumatic fever, then, are conditions
from which the expectant mother, even more
than the ordinary individual, is entitled to be protected.
But this is of minor importance. We may here refer,
however, to one or two striking cases, especially since<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_247" id="p_247">[247]</a></span>
they bear in some degree upon social and individual
duty.</p>

<p><em class="psection">The racial influence of lead.</em>&mdash;In the first place, it is
necessary to draw attention to a really notable racial
poison, viz., lead.</p>

<p>Says Sir Thomas Oliver,<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> “Lead destroys the reproductive
powers of both men and women, but its special
influence upon women during pregnancy is the cause of
a great destruction of human life.” It may be said that
in a sense the production of miscarriages and still-births,
and also of infant mortality by lead, does not concern
the student of race-culture. Nevertheless some of these
children survive. Says Sir Thomas Oliver: “I have seen
both cretinism and imbecility in infants in whom, as there
could have been no possible influence of alcohol, and presumably
none of syphilis, the occupation of one or other
parent as a lead worker must have determined the
imperfectly developed nervous system of the child.”
Later he says (page 202): “Salpétrière and Bicêtre are
large hospitals in Paris set aside for the reception and
treatment of nervous diseases. The experience of the
physicians of these institutions is unrivalled. One of the
physicians, M. Roques, speaking of the degenerates found
in these hospitals, says that slowly induced lead poisoning
on the part of both parents or in one or other of them is
not only a cause of repeated abortions, high percentage
of still-births and high death-rate of infants, but is the
cause of convulsions, imbecility, and idiocy in many of
the children who survive the first year of existence. Of
nineteen children born to parents who were lead workers,
Rennert found that one child was still-born and that
seventeen were macrocephalic. In his studies upon
hereditary degeneration and idiocy, Bourneville places
house-painters in the unenviable first rank of the occupations<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_248" id="p_248">[248]</a></span>
followed by parents of mentally weak children.
Out of eighty-seven cases relating to unhealthy trades,
fifty-one were connected with white lead in some form or
another, while syphilis was only responsible for nineteen.”</p>

<p>This racial influence of lead is by no means generally
recognised&mdash;even by Royal Commissioners. Its
parallelism with the case of alcohol is striking. We
may note, for instance, that paternal lead-poisoning,
like paternal alcoholism, can cause degeneration in
the offspring, if not indeed death before or shortly
after birth. To quote Oliver again: “Taking seven
healthy women who were married to lead workers, and
in whom there was a total of thirty-two pregnancies,
Lewin tells us that the results were as follows: eleven
miscarriages, one still-birth, eight children died within
the first year after birth, four in the second year, five in
the third, and one subsequent to this, leaving only two
children out of thirty-two pregnancies, as likely to live
to manhood. In cases where women have a series of
miscarriages so long as their husbands worked in lead,
a change of industrial occupation on the part of the
husbands restores to the wives normal child-bearing
powers.” According to the statistical enquiry of Rennert,
the malign influence of lead is exerted upon the next
generation, ninety-four times out of one hundred when
both parents have been working in lead, ninety-two
times when the mother alone is affected, and sixty-three
times when it is the father alone who has worked in lead.
Here, then, as in the case of alcohol, the racial poison
may act either through the father or through the mother,
but especially through the mother. The importance of
the demonstration as regards the father in the case of
both poisons is that it means a poisoning of the paternal
germ-cell. The facts may be commended to those
extremists, so much more Weismannian than Weismann,<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_249" id="p_249">[249]</a></span>
who regard the germ-cells as existing in a universe of
their own, wholly unrelated to the rest of existence.</p>

<p>Another extremely interesting parallel between these
two racial poisons may be noted. It is found, according
to Professor Oliver, that “while following a healthy
occupation these women, after having frequently miscarried
when working in lead factories, would have two
or three living healthy children, but circumstances
necessitating the return of these women to town, and
resumption of work in the lead factory, they in each
successive pregnancy again miscarried.” He then quotes
the following most remarkable case: “Mrs. K., aged
thirty-four, had four children before going into the
factory and two children after. She then had six miscarriages
in succession, when she came under my care in
the Royal Infirmary, having become the victim of plumbism
and having lost the power in her arms and legs.
She made a slow but good recovery and did not return
to the lead works. In her next pregnancy she went to
full term and gave birth to a living child.”</p>

<p>We see here that, as is also true in the case of alcoholism,
the germinal tissue itself may escape or at any rate may
recover from the effects of chronic poisoning of the
individual who is its host. The race is more resistant
than the individual. If, however, the poisoning continues
whilst a new individual is being formed&mdash;that is
to say, during pregnancy&mdash;that new individual succumbs,
and indeed is far more gravely affected than its mother.
Such a pregnant woman presents three distinct living
objects for our study. Her own body is one: and this
is already developed. It has some measure of resistance
to the poison but is gravely affected. The embryo is the
second; it is developing and because developing is
susceptible. It is usually killed before birth. The third
is the germ-plasm or the race, and this, as we have seen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_250" id="p_250">[250]</a></span>
may withstand the poison so well that when the poisoning
is discontinued healthy children may be produced from
it. Undoubtedly the case is the same as regards alcohol.
The race or germ-plasm is most resistant, the developing
individual is least resistant, and the adult individual&mdash;that
is to say, the mother&mdash;occupies an intermediate
position in this respect.</p>

<p>This parallelism, which has escaped previous observers,
may be pointed out and its remarkable interest and
significance suggested as a definite advance upon the
absurd view that the germ-plasm is incapable of
being poisoned. On the contrary, we know that many
poisons will kill it outright, so that sterility results. But
its high degree of resistance is a fact of great interest.
Doubtless Dr. Archdall Reid's acute explanation of it
is correct: namely, that natural selection would tend
to evolve a resistant germ-plasm. Dr. Reid will, I
think, be interested to notice in these remarkable observations
on lead-poisoning a conspicuous illustration of this
resistance.</p>

<p>Our business here, however, is with the practical issue.
This fortunately is plain, nor are there the same difficulties
of vested interests which arise in the case of alcohol.
Lead-poisoning must be ended in the interests of race-culture
and the essential wealth of the nation, or, if it
is to be continued, it must at least have its clutches
kept clear of parenthood.</p>

<p><em class="psection">The possible racial influence of narcotics.</em>&mdash;Alcohol
is of course a narcotic poison, or, more precisely still, a
narcotic-irritant poison, but here we may briefly refer
to the possible racial influence of certain other poisons.
There is, for instance, the case, noted on p. 212,
of the disastrous racial consequences of the cocaine
habit. The matter demands only a paragraph, since
for the present, at least, it is of small general<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_251" id="p_251">[251]</a></span>
importance, and since we must beware of going beyond
the facts; but when once the idea of race-culture
has reached the popular and professional mind&mdash;the
latter at present frequently feeding the pregnant woman
with alcohol, as we all know&mdash;the whole question of
narcomania will have to be looked at from this aspect,
and the measure of danger in particular cases will then
be ascertained. It is probably safe to assume, however,
that, on the whole, alcohol will be found to stand somewhat
apart from other narcotics, and for the reason that
it is not a pure narcotic but also an irritant. Thus,
to take the case of opium, it will probably be very difficult
and, one may hope, impossible to show that, shall we say,
opium smoking or eating has an injurious racial influence
where it is practised. Here we have a narcotic which
is not an irritant. The individual may recover perfectly
from its abuse, as he may often fail to recover from the
abuse of alcohol, since this poison leaves permanent
changes in the brain, and elsewhere, dependent upon the
fact that it is not merely a narcotic but also a local irritant.
The action of a pure narcotic on the germ-plasm as compared
with the action of a narcotic which is also an
irritant may afford a parallel. The abuse of opium by the
expectant mother (see p. <a href="#p_212">212</a>) is not of the same order:
it means simply dosing a <i>very</i> small baby with opium.</p>

<p><em class="psection">Tobacco and the race.</em>&mdash;The poisonous compounds
absorbed from tobacco smoke are of interest in this
connection. The question as to the proportion of nicotine
included amongst them is immaterial here. It suffices
to know, as we do, that certain substances, doubtless
including some proportion of nicotine, rapidly absorbed
into the blood by the smoker, are poisons to the individual
body. The familiar fact of the acquirement of immunity
affects in no degree the statement as to the toxic character
of these substances.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p_252" id="p_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>No one but the fanatic would venture to say that
any racial degeneration can be traced to tobacco-smoking.
It would be hard to prove the existence of any injury
thus inflicted upon the children of the father who is a
smoker, though the question of the acquirement of
immunity is not without relevance here. The immunising
substances or anti-toxins which are doubtless produced
in the smoker's blood may protect the germ-plasm which
he bears as well as his own body.</p>

<p>But in the case of the expectant mother there is more
warrant for offering an opinion even in the absence
hitherto of definite evidence. Apart from any opinion
as to the propriety of smoking by women in general,
there is a definite issue in the case of the expectant mother.
A very young child is now being exposed to the poisons
of tobacco smoke, and if we are right in passing laws
to prevent this poisoning in the case of the urchin of
eight years (who is really, of course, eight years and
nine months old), what shall we say regarding the unborn
child who is only eight months old? I have observed
that the expectant mother may have her liking for
tobacco replaced by violent dislike during pregnancy.</p>

<p><em class="psection">The poison of syphilis.</em>&mdash;Brief mention must here
be made of syphilis as a racial poison. Sooner or
later the eugenic campaign must and will face this
question, about which a murderous silence is now maintained.
No other disease can rival syphilis in its hideous
influence upon parenthood and the future. But it is no
crime for a man to marry, infect his innocent bride and
their children: no crime against the laws of our little
lawgivers, but a heinous outrage against Nature's decrees.
When, at last, our laws are based on Nature's laws,
criminal marriages of this kind may be put an end to.</p>

<p>The lay reader should acquaint himself with the play
of Brieux, <i>Les Avariés</i>. The student may be referred to<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_253" id="p_253">[253]</a></span>
Forel's <i>Sexual Question</i>, Dr. C. F. Marshall's <i>Syphilology
and Venereal Diseases</i>, and his article, “Alcohol and
Syphilis” in the <i>British Journal of Inebriety</i>, January,
1908.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This chapter and the last do not profess to do more
than indicate the field of eugenics which the term racial
poisons suggests. Our business in the present volume is,
if possible, to see eugenics whole: to treat of this new
science adequately is not for one author or one generation.
It is earnestly to be hoped that the medical
profession will speedily take up this question of the
racial poisons. Already the profession is beginning to
become the great instrument of <i>individual hygiene</i>: and
every year will enhance the importance of this work, as
compared with the cure of disease. Now negative
eugenics is substantially <i>racial hygiene</i>: and the next
great epoch in the evolution of medicine and the medical
profession will be the enrolment of its knowledge and
influence in the cause of racial hygiene. May this book
do a little to hasten that day.</p>

<p>The two next chapters are designed to introduce that
aspect of our subject which may be called National
Eugenics, and especially with reference to decadence.
Here is a matter which appeals to minds of type and
training often very different from the typical medical
mind. But it is part of one's purpose to show, if possible,
that the historian must become a eugenist, just as the
physician must, for eugenics needs and claims the work
and help of both.</p>

<p>The reader will not expect to be insulted here with any

If history be, as nearly all historians have conceived
it, and as Gibbon defined it, “little more than the register
of the crimes, follies, and misfortunes of mankind,” it
is an empty and contemptible study, save for the social
pathologist. But if history, without by any means
ignoring great men or underrating their influence, is, or
should be, the record of the past life of mankind, of progress
and decadence, the rise and fall of Empires and
civilisations, and their mutual reactions; if it be the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_255" id="p_255">[255]</a></span>record of the intermittent ascent of man, “sagging but
pertinacious”; if this record be subject to the law of
causation, and therefore susceptible, in theory, at least,
of explanation as well as description; if its factors are
at work to-day and will shape the destiny of all the to-morrows;
if it be neither phantasmagoria nor panorama
nor pageant nor procession but <i>process</i>, in short, an
organic drama,&mdash;then, indeed, it is more than worthy
of all the study and thought of all who ever study or ever
think. Especially must it appeal to us, who boast a
tradition greater than the world has ever yet seen, and
kinship with men who represent the utmost of which
the human spirit has yet shown itself capable,&mdash;to us
who speak the tongue that Shakespeare spake, but to
whom the names of all our Imperial predecessors, from
Babylon to Spain, serve as a perpetual <i>memento mori</i>.
Our special question here is whether there are inherent
and necessary reasons why our predecessors' fate must
sooner or later be ours. Must races die?&mdash;or, if we
are sceptical about races and more especially about the
so-called Anglo-Saxon race, must civilisations, states,
or nations die? What comment does modern biology,
or the theory of organic evolution, make upon the familiar
words of Byron in his address to the ocean?&mdash;</p>

how much easier should it not be to <i>maintain</i> it?</p>

<p>Two explanations, each falsely asserting itself to be
rooted in biological fact, have long been cited and are
still cited in order to account for these supreme tragedies
of history.</p>

<p><em class="psection">The fallacy of racial senility.</em>&mdash;The first may claim
Plato and Aristotle as its founders, and consists of an
argument from analogy. Races may be conceived
in similar terms to individuals. There are many
resemblances between a society&mdash;a “social organism,”
to use Herbert Spencer's phrase&mdash;and an individual
organism. Just, then, as the individual is mortal, so is
the race. Each has its birth, its period of youth and
growth, its maturity, and, finally, its decadence, senility
and death. So runs the common argument.</p>

<p>We must reply, however, that biology, so far from
confirming it, declares as the capital fact which contrasts
the individual and the race that, whilst the individual
is doomed to die from inherent causes, the race is naturally
immortal. The tendency of life is not to die but to live.
If individuals die, that is doubtless because, as I believe,
more life and fuller is thus attained than if life bodied
itself in immortal forms: but the germ-plasm is immortal;
it has no inherent tendency either to degenerate
or to die. Species exist and flourish now which are millions
of years older than mankind. “The individual withers,
the race is more and more.”</p>

<p>It may be added that, in historical instances, civilisations
have, on the one hand, persisted, and, on the other,<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_257" id="p_257">[257]</a></span>
fallen, despite change, and even substitution, in the
races which created them: and, on the other hand,
the most conspicuously persistent of all races in the
historic epoch, the Jews, have survived one Empire
after another of their oppressors, but have never had
an Empire of their own. Thus, so far as the historian
is concerned, it is not races at all that die, but civilisations
and Empires. Plato's argument from the individual
to the race is therefore irrelevant, as well as untrue.
The fatalistic conception to which it tempts us, saying
that races must die, just as individuals must, and that
therefore it is idle to repine or oppose, is utterly unwarrantable
and extremely unhealthy. To take our own
case, despite the talk about our own racial decadence,
nearly all our babies still come into the world fit and strong
and healthy&mdash;the racial poisons apart. We kill them in
scores of thousands every year, but this infant mortality
is not a sign that the race is dying, but a sign that even
the most splendid living material can be killed or damaged
if you try hard enough. The babies do not die because
races are mortal, but because individuals are and we
kill them. The babies drink poison, eat poison, and
breathe poison, and in due course die. The theory of
racial senility, inapplicable everywhere because untrue,
is most of all inapplicable here. If a race became sterile,
Plato and Aristotle would be right. There is no such
instance in history, apart from well-defined external,
<i>not inherent</i>, causes, as in the case of the Tasmanians. Dismissing
this analogy, we may also dismiss, as based upon
nothing better, the idea that the great tragedies of history
were necessary events at all. We must look elsewhere
than amongst the inherent and necessary factors of
racial life for the causes which determine these tragedies;
and we shall be entitled to assume as conceivable the
proposition that, notwithstanding the consistent fall of<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_258" id="p_258">[258]</a></span>
all our predecessors, the causes are not inevitable, but,
being external and environmental, may possibly be
controlled: man being not only creature but creator also.</p>

<p><em class="psection">The Lamarckian explanation of decadence.</em>&mdash;The
second of the two false interpretations of history in terms
of biology is still, and always has been, widely credited.
When historians have paid any attention to the breed of
a people as determining its destiny, they have invariably
added to the fallacy of racial senility this no less fecund
error. It is that, in consequence of success, a people
become idle, thoughtless, unenterprising, luxurious, and
that these <i>acquired characters are transmitted</i> to succeeding
generations so that, finally, there is produced a degenerate
people unable to bear the burden of Empire&mdash;and then
the crash comes. The historian usually introduces the
idea already dismissed by saying that a “young and
vigorous race” invaded the Imperial territories&mdash;and
so forth. The terms “young” and “old,” applied to
human races, usually mean nothing at all.</p>

<p>The reader will recognise, of course, in this doctrine
of the transmission to children of characters acquired
by their parents, the explanation of organic evolution
advanced by Lamarck rather more than a century ago.
It is employed by historians for the explanation of both
the processes they record, progress and retrogression.
Thus they suppose that for many generations a race
is disciplined, and so at last there is produced a race
with discipline in its very bone; or for many generations
a nation finds it necessary to make adventure upon the
sea, and so at last there is produced a generation of
predestined sailors with blue water in its blood. And
in similar terms moral and physical retrogression or
degeneration are explained.</p>

<p>Let us consider the contrast between the interpretation
which accepts the Lamarckian theory of the transmission<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_259" id="p_259">[259]</a></span>
of acquired characters and that which does not. Consider
the babies of a new generation. According to
Lamarck, these have in their blood and brain the consequences
of the habits of their ancestors. If these
have been idle and luxurious, the new babies are predestined
to be idle and luxurious too. This, in short,
is a “dying nation.” But, if acquired characters are
not transmitted, the new generation is, on the whole,
not much better, not much worse, than its predecessors&mdash;so
far as this supposed factor of change is concerned.
Each generation makes a fresh start, as we see in the
babies of our slums to-day. It does not begin where the
last left off&mdash;whether that means beginning at a higher
or at a lower level than that at which the last started: but
it makes a fresh start where the last did.</p>

<p>Now, in general, we have seen that Lamarck's theory
is discredited. The view of Mr. Galton is accepted, that
acquired characters are not transmitted, either for good
or for evil. If there are no other factors of racial degeneration
or racial advance, then races do not degenerate
or advance, but make a fresh start every generation:
and Empires rise and fall without any relation to the
breed of the Imperial people&mdash;an incredible proposition.</p>

<p><em class="psection">The racial poisons and decadence.</em>&mdash;Certain apparent,
though not real, exceptions exist to the denial of
the Lamarckian theory of the transmission of acquired
characters. These exceptions are furnished by what
I have called the <i>racial poisons</i>. Alcohol, for instance,
is a substance, certainly poisonous in all but very
small doses, if not in them, which is carried by the
blood to every part of the body and may and does injure
its <i>racial</i> elements. Thus a true racial degeneration may
be caused by its means: and the possibility of this
is not to be ignored. Other poisons, such as those of
certain diseases, act similarly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p_260" id="p_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>We must therefore note in passing a biological factor
of historical importance, though hitherto entirely unrecognised
by historians, and that is disease. Certain of
our diseases, and especially consumption or tuberculosis,
are at present making history by their extermination of
aboriginal races. Minute living creatures, which we call
microbes, are introduced into the new and favourable
environment constituted by the blood and tissues of
human races hitherto unacquainted with them: and the
consequences are known to all. But further, it has lately
been suggested as highly probable, by Professor Ross and
others, that the fall of Greece, that incalculable disaster
for mankind, was due to the invasion not of human foes
but of the humble living species which are responsible for
the disease miscalled malaria. The evidence for this view
is by no means slight, and the most recent explanation
of an event so abrupt and so disastrous is in all likelihood
the correct one. Malaria, like alcohol, produces true
racial degeneration, its poisons affecting those <i>racial
elements</i> of which the individual body, biologically conceived,
is merely the ephemeral host: recalling the great
line of Lucretius, “<i>et quasi cursores, vitaï lampada tradunt</i>.”
To lame the runner is not to injure the torch
he bears&mdash;acquired characters are not transmitted; but
the racial poison makes dim the lamp ere the runner
passes it on.</p>

<p><em class="psection">Selection and racial change.</em>&mdash;But, leaving poisons out
of the question, races of men and animals <i>do</i> undergo
change, progressive and retrogressive, in consequence of
the action of another factor than that advanced by
Lamarck: and this is the factor of “natural selection”
or “survival of the fittest.” If, of any generation,
individuals of a certain kind are chosen by the environment
for survival and parenthood, the character of
the species will change accordingly. If what we call<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_261" id="p_261">[261]</a></span>
the best are chosen, their goodness will be transmitted
in some degree, and the race will advance: if what we
call the worst are chosen, their badness will be transmitted
in some degree, and the race will degenerate.</p>

<p><em class="psection">The two kinds of progress.</em>&mdash;Now in the case of all
species other than man, the only possible progress is this
racial or inherent progress, dependent upon a choice or
selection of parents, and comparable in some measure,
as Darwin showed, with the change similarly produced
in the selective breeding or “artificial selection” of the
lower animals by man. But in the case of man himself,
there is a wholly different kind of progress also attainable,
which is not inherent or racial progress at all, but yet is
real progress: and which has the most important relations
to the inherent or racial progress that might be
achieved by the process of natural selection, or the choice
of parents.</p>

<p>It has been laid down that acquired characters are not
transmissible by heredity: but man has learnt&mdash;and it
is well for him&mdash;to circumvent the laws of heredity by
transmitting his spiritual acquirements through language
and art. Even before writing there was tradition, passed
on from mouth to mouth. As long as man was without
writing he advanced little faster than other creatures, we
may surmise: we know that he has an undistinguished past
of probably at least six million years: but with speech
<i>and writing</i> came the transmission of acquirements in this
special sense; not that the past education of a mother
will enlarge her baby's brain, but that she can teach her
daughter what she has learnt, and so the child can begin
where the parent left off, just as Lamarck wrongly
imagined to be the case with the young giraffe, that he
supposed to profit by the stretching of the parental
necks. It is this transmission of spiritual acquirements&mdash;outside
the germ-plasm and in defiance of its laws&mdash;that<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_262" id="p_262">[262]</a></span>
explains the amazing advance of man in the last ten or
twenty thousand years as compared with the almost
speechless ages before them.</p>

<p>This kind of progress is peculiar to man,<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> it is the gift
of intelligence, and we may call it traditional or acquired
progress. It is an utterly different thing from inherent
or racial progress, an improvement in the breed dependent
upon the happy choice of parents. And it is surely
evident, on a moment's consideration, that acquired
progress is compatible with inherent decadence. To use
Coleridge's image, a dwarf may see further than a giant
if he sits on the giant's shoulders: yet he is a dwarf and
the other a giant. Any schoolboy now knows more than
Aristotle, and that is true progress of a kind, but the
schoolboy may well be a dwarf compared with Aristotle,
and may belong to a race degenerate when compared
with his; <i>and that is inherent or racial decadence subsisting
with acquired or traditional progress</i>.</p>

<p>Now whilst the accumulation of knowledge and art
and power from age to age is real progress, it evidently
depends for its stability and persistence upon the quality
of the race.<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> If the race degenerates&mdash;through, say, the
selection of the worst for parenthood&mdash;the time will come
when its heritage is too much for it. The pearls of the
ancestral art are now cast before swine, and are trampled
on: statues, temples, books are destroyed or burnt or
lost. If an Empire has been built, the degenerate race
cannot sustain it. <i>There is no wealth but life: and if the
quality of the life fails, neither battleships nor libraries nor
symphonies nor anything else will save a nation.</i> This we
all know, though no one who observed our legislation or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_263" id="p_263">[263]</a></span>read our Parliamentary debates would suspect that it
had ever entered into our minds. Empires and civilisations,
then, have fallen, despite the strength and magnitude
of the superstructure, because the foundations
decayed: and the bigger and heavier the superstructure
the less could it survive their failure. If
the Fiji islanders degenerate, there is little consequence:
if the breed of Romans degenerate, all their
vast mass of acquired progress and power crushes
them into dramatic ruin. This image, I believe, truly
expresses the relation between the two wholly distinct
kinds of progress, which we have yet to learn to distinguish.
Acquired progress will not compensate for
racial or inherent decadence. If the race is going down,
it will not compensate to add another colony to your
Empire: on the contrary, the bigger the Empire the
stronger must be the race: the bigger the superstructure
the stronger the foundations. Acquired progress is real
progress, but it is always dependent for its maintenance
upon racial or inherent progress&mdash;or, at least, upon
racial maintenance.</p>

<p><em class="psection">Nothing fails like success.</em>&mdash;I believe, then, that
civilisations and Empires have succumbed because they
represented only acquired or traditional or educational
progress and this availed not at all when the races
that built them up began to degenerate. Now the
only explanation of racial degeneration yet offered
by the historians&mdash;apart from the foolish one of racial
senility&mdash;is the Lamarckian one of the transmission
of habits of luxury and idleness from parent to child:
an explanation which the modern study of heredity
empowers us to repudiate. What theory of this alleged
degeneration is there to offer in its place: and
especially what theory which explains racial degeneration
amongst not the conquered but the conquerors:<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_264" id="p_264">[264]</a></span>
amongst the successful, the Imperial, the cultured, the
leisured, the well-catered for in all respects, bodily and
mental? Why is it that not enslaved but Imperial
peoples degenerate? Why is it that nothing fails like
success?</p>

<p>What I believe to be the true and sufficient answer has
been given by no historian: but the key to it is only
fifty years old. The reason is that no race or species,
vegetable or animal or human, can maintain&mdash;much less
raise&mdash;its organic level unless its best be selected for
parenthood. It is true of a race as of an individual that
it must work for its living&mdash;so to speak&mdash;if it is not to
degenerate. When the terms are too easy, down you go.
The tape-worm has given up even digesting for its living,
and we know its degeneracy&mdash;all hooks and mouth.
Society works and hands over its predigested food to such
social parasites amongst ourselves. You must struggle
or you will degenerate&mdash;even if only with rhyme or
counterpoint, not necessarily for bread. “Effort is the
law,” as Ruskin said: whether for a livelihood or for
enjoyment. Living things are the product of the struggle
for existence: we are thus evolved strugglers by constitution:
and directly we cease to struggle we forfeit
the possibilities of our birthright. “Thou, O God,”
said Leonardo, “hast given all good things to man at the
price of labour.”</p>

<p>The case is the same with races. Directly the conditions
become too easy, selection ceases, and it is as
successful to be incompetent or lazy or vicious as to be
worthy. The hard conditions that kept weeding out the
unworthy are now relaxed and the fine race they made
goes back again. Finally there occurs the phenomenon
of <i>reversed selection</i>, when it is fitter to be bad than good,
cowardly than brave&mdash;as when religious persecution murders
all who are true to themselves and spares hypocrites<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_265" id="p_265">[265]</a></span>
and apostates: or when healthy children are killed
in factories whilst feeble-minded children or deaf-mutes
are carefully tended until maturity and then sent into
the world to reproduce their maladies. Under reversed
selection such results are obtained as a breeder of race-horses
or plants would obtain if he went to work on
similar lines: the race degenerates rapidly: and if it
be an Imperial race its Empire comes crashing down
about its ears. All Empires and civilisations hitherto
have involved the partial or complete arrest or reversal
of the process of natural selection: and the racial degeneration
which necessarily ensued has been the cause
of their invariable doom.</p>

<p>When a primitive race is making its way by force,
selection is stringent. The weak, cowardly, diseased,
stupid are expunged from generation to generation. As
civilisation advances, a higher ethical level is reached:
all true civilisation tending to abrogate and ameliorate
the struggle for existence. The diseased and weakly and
feeble-minded are no longer left to pay the penalty
sternly exacted by Nature for unfitness: they are allowed
to survive and multiply. A successful race can apparently
afford to permit this, as a race that is fighting
for its existence cannot. But in reality no race can
afford this absolutely fatal process.</p>

<p>There is thus a real risk involved in the accumulation
of acquired, traditional or educational progress. Not
only does it tend to abrogate or even to reverse selection,
but it serves to disguise the consequences of this abrogation.
If a subhuman race degenerates the fact is evident:
but such a nation as our own may quite well degenerate
whilst the accumulation of acquired progress, transmitted
by education, almost completely cloaks the fact <i>for a
time</i>. We may be congratulating ourselves upon our
progress, upon our knowledge, our science and art, our<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_266" id="p_266">[266]</a></span>
institutions, legal and charitable, whilst all the time the
breed is undergoing retrogression.</p>

<p>We see now, I think, the explanation of the truth
expressed by Gibbon,&mdash;“all that is human must retrograde
if it do not advance.” Why should this be so?
Why should it not be possible merely to maintain a
position gained? The answer is that the civilisation
which merely maintains its position is one in which
selection has ceased: if selection had not ceased, the
position would be more than maintained, there would be
advance. But without selection the breed will certainly
degenerate, the lower individuals multiplying more rapidly
than higher ones, in accordance with Spencer's law that
the higher the type of the individual the less rapidly does
he multiply; and thus the race which is not advancing
is retrograding, as Gibbon declared.</p>

<p>Natural selection is the sole factor of efficient and
permanent progress, but the traditional or acquired progress
which we call civilisation tends to thwart or abrogate
or even invert this process. I thus believe that the
conditions necessary for the <i>secure</i> ascent of any race,
an ascent secured in its very blood, made stable in its
very bone, have not yet been achieved in history: <i>and
I advance this as the reason why history records no enduring
Empire</i>.</p>

<p><em class="psection">Some historical instances.</em>&mdash;In the face of certain
facts of contemporary history I do not for a moment
assert that there are no other causes of Imperial failure
than the arrest or reversal of selection. But I do assert
that if this is not the cause, then, in the absence of
the transmission of acquired characters, the race has
not degenerated, and is capable of reasserting itself.
Only by the arrest or reversal of selection can a race
degenerate&mdash;apart from the racial poisons. If, then, a
civilisation or Empire has fallen through causes altogether<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_267" id="p_267">[267]</a></span>
non-biological&mdash;through carelessness, or neglect of
motherhood or alteration of ideals&mdash;the changes in
character so produced are not transmitted to the
children, and the race is not degenerate but merely
deteriorated in each generation.</p>

<p>For instance, we have been brought up to believe that
there is no possible future for Spain; it is a dying nation,
a senile individual, a people of degenerates; it has had
its day, which can never return. The historian explains
this by the false analogy between a race and an individual,
and by the false Lamarckian theory of heredity. To
these the biologist retorts with comments upon their
falsity, and with the conviction that since Spain, even
allowing for the anti-eugenic labours of the Inquisition,
has not been subjected to the only process which can
ensure real degeneration&mdash;viz., the consistent and stringent
selection of the worst&mdash;she is yet capable of regeneration.
Regeneration is not really the word, because there has
been little real degeneration, but only the successive
deterioration of successive and undegenerate generations.</p>

<p>If we took an animal species that <i>has</i> degenerated, such
as the intestinal parasites, and endeavoured to regenerate
them, we should begin to realise the magnitude of our
task. That is not the task for Spain, the biologist asserts.
Merely the environment must be altered,&mdash;not the mountain
ranges and the rivers, Buckle notwithstanding, but
the really potent factors in the environment, the spiritual
and psychical and social factors&mdash;and the deterioration
of each new generation, inherently undegenerate, will
cease. I am using these opposed terms with great care
and of set purpose.</p>

<p>And the biologist is right. The facts concerning which
so many historians have shaken their heads, and upon
which they have based so many moralisings and theories
of history, the facts which they have cited in support<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_268" id="p_268">[268]</a></span>
of their false analogies and misconceptions of heredity&mdash;due,
of course, to the errors of former biology&mdash;turn out
to be not facts at all, or, at any rate, only facts of the
moment. The “dying nation,” as Lord Salisbury called it,
has occasion to alter its psychical environment. It introduces
the practice of education; it begins to shake off the
yoke of ecclesiasticism; and what are the consequences?</p>

<p>The new generation is found to be potentially little
worse and little better than its predecessors of the sixteenth
century. There has been no national or racial
degeneration. The environment is modified for the
better, <i>i.e.</i>, so as to choose the better, and Spain, as they
say in misleading phrase, “takes on a new lease of life.”
The historian of the present day, knowing as a historian
what qualities of blood have been in the Spanish people,
and basing his theories upon sound biology, must confidently
assert that that blood, incapable, as he knows,
of degeneration by any Lamarckian process, may still
retain its ancient quality and will yet make history.</p>

<p>But the historian might well write a volume upon the
same thesis as applied to China and Japan. We know
historically what were the immediate effects in one
generation of a total change of environment in Japan.
That change has not yet occurred in China, but must
inevitably occur. Consider for a moment how the
historian, made far-sighted and clear-sighted by biology,
must contemplate the history of this astounding people.
The popular belief used to be that China illustrated the
so-called law of nations. It was the decadent, though
monstrous, relic of an ancient civilisation; it had had
its day. Inevitable degeneration, which must befall all
peoples, had come upon it. Behold it in the paralysis
which precedes death!</p>

<p>But in the light of the facts of Japan, the man in the
street and the historian alike have in this case found<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_269" id="p_269">[269]</a></span>
modern biology superfluous in enabling them to arrive
at sound conclusions. They now believe what the
Darwinian has been compelled to believe for half a
century, and more strongly than ever during the latter
part of that period, when the doctrine of the transmission
of modifications was finally discredited. A clever writer
invents the phrase “the yellow peril,” and people
discard their old theories. The metaphor must be
changed. This is not paralysis, but merely slumber.
Doubtless, it is an unnatural slumber; doubtless, it is not
the slumber which brings renewed strength. It is suspense
or stupor, not recuperation; but assuredly it is not
paralysis. Who now would dare to say that China has
had its day, even if he still clings to the old fictions about
Spain?</p>

<p><em class="psection">Motherhood and history.</em>&mdash;Here, also, reference must
again be made to another factor of history to which, as I
think, the biologist must attach enormous importance,
but which no historian yet has adequately reckoned with.
Our prime assumption from beginning to end is that
“there is no wealth but life,” or, if one may venture to
improve upon Ruskin, <i>there is no wealth but mind</i>;
and in the attempt to suggest interpretations of history
based upon this truth, so little recked of by the historian,
we have considered the life in question from the point of
view of its determination by heredity, and its varying
value according to the inherent and transmissible characters
selected in each generation. But a word must be said
as to the other factor which, with heredity, determines
the character of the individual&mdash;and that factor is the
environment. I wish merely to note the most important
aspect of the environment of human beings, and to observe
that historians hitherto have wholly ignored it; yet its
influence is incalculable. I refer to motherhood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p_270" id="p_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p>One might have the most perfect system of selection of
the finest and highest individuals for parenthood; but the
babies whose potentialities&mdash;heredity gives no more&mdash;are
so splendid, are always, will be always, dependent upon
motherhood. What was the state of motherhood during
the decline and fall of the Roman Empire? This factor
counts in history; and always will count so long as, three
times in every century, the only wealth of nations is
reduced to dust, and is raised again from helpless infancy.
As to Rome we know little, whatever may be suspected:
but we know that here in the heart of the greatest Empire
in history&mdash;and it is at the heart that Empires rot&mdash;thousands
of mothers go out every day to tend dead
machines, whilst their own flesh and blood, with whom
lies the Imperial destiny, are tended anyhow or not at
all. It may yet be said by some enlightened historian
of the future that the living wealth of this people, in the
twentieth century, began to be eaten away by the cancer
which we call “married women's labour,” and that, as
will be evident to that historian's readers, its damnation
was sure. To-day our historians and politicians think in
terms of regiments and tariffs and “Dreadnoughts”: the
time will come when they must think in terms of babies and
motherhood. We must think in such terms too if we wish
Great Britain to be much longer great. Meanwhile some of
us see the perennial slaughter of babies in this land, and the
deterioration of many for every one killed outright, the
waste of mothers' travail and tears: and we recall
Ruskin's words:&mdash;</p>

<p><em class="psection">The survival of the Jews.</em>&mdash;The principles the discussion
of which has here been attempted had all
been set down before it suddenly seemed clear that
they found their warrant and application in the unexampled
riddle of the persistence and success, throughout
more than two thousand years and a thousand
vicissitudes, of the Jewish people. It is true that
we have here no exception to the apparent law that
Empires are mortal, for within this period there never was
a Jewish Empire: the Jews were never subject to the
risk involved for racial or inherent progress by the possession
of great acquired powers. But just as the fall of
Empires has often <i>not</i> been the fall of races&mdash;various races<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_273" id="p_273">[273]</a></span>
having at various times carried on the same Imperial
tradition&mdash;so the persistence of the Jews, as contrasted
with the impermanence of Empires, <i>has</i> been the persistence
of a race. I believe that the principles already
laid down offer us an adequate explanation of this unique
case: and further, that if we had begun with the case
of the Jews, endeavouring, by the investigation of their
case, to explain the contrasted case of other races and of all
Empires hitherto, we should have arrived at the same
principles.</p>

<p>It has been asserted that that race or people decays in
which selection ceases or is reversed; that in the absence
of selection of the worthy for parenthood, no species,
vegetable, animal or human, can prosper&mdash;much less progress.
Now the Jews, the one human race of which we
know assuredly that it has persisted unimpaired, have
been the most continuously and stringently selected of<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_274" id="p_274">[274]</a></span>
any race, I suppose, that can be named. Every measure
of persecution and repression practised against them by
the people amongst whom they have lived, has directly
tended towards the very end which those people least
desired to compass. Other peoples found themselves
prosperous through the efforts of their fathers; the
struggle for existence abated; it was, so to say, as fit to be
unfit as to be fit&mdash;with the inevitable result. But this has
never been the case of the Jews. They have always had
to struggle for life intensely: and their unexampled
struggle has been a great source of their unexampled
strength. The Jew who was a weakling or a fool had no
chance at all; the weaklings and the fools being weeded
out, intensity and strength of mind became the common
heritage of this amazing people.</p>

<p>Secondly, there was everything to favour motherhood.
Here religious precept and ethical tradition joined with
stem necessity to the same end&mdash;the end which always
meant a new and strong beginning for the next generation.
Even to-day all observers are agreed that infant mortality
is at a minimum amongst the Jews; their children are
superior in height and weight and chest measurement to
Gentile children brought up amidst poverty far less
intense in our own great cities; <i>in a better material
environment, but a far inferior maternal environment</i>.
The Jewish mother is the mother of children innately
superior, on the average, since they are the fruit of such
long ages of stringent parental selection, and she
makes more of them because she fails to nurse them
only in the rarest cases, when she has no choice, and
because in every detail her maternal care is incomparably
superior to that of her Gentile sister. Given a high
standard of motherhood in a highly selected race, what
other result than that we daily witness and envy can we
expect?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p_275" id="p_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>Thirdly, the Jews do not abuse alcohol, and thus avoid
one of the few causes of true racial degeneration apart from
selection of the worst for parenthood.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>If these principles are valid, it is evident that our
redemption from the fate of all our predecessors is to be
found only in Eugenics&mdash;the selection of the best for
parenthood. In his address to the Sociological Society
in 1904, in which he defined this term, Mr. Galton named
as one of the duties before the Society, “historical enquiry
into the rates with which the various classes of society
(classified according to civic usefulness) have contributed
to the population at various times, in ancient and modern
nations.” “There is strong reason for believing,” he
continued, “that national rise and decline is closely
connected with this influence.”<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p><em class="psection">What is a good environment?</em>&mdash;Using the word
environment in its widest sense, including, for instance,
public opinion&mdash;and its use in any sense less wide is
always erroneous and misleading&mdash;we may say that it
is our business to provide the environment which selects
the best for parenthood and discourages the parenthood
of the worst&mdash;say the deaf and dumb, the feeble-minded,
the insane, the epileptic, the inebriate, those
afflicted with hereditary disease of other kinds, and so
forth. Our principles should enable us, also, I think, to
define what we mean by a good environment. Comprehensive
and indiscriminate charity means a good
environment for many in a sense, but it may also mean
the selection of the worst for parenthood&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, the feeble-minded.
This “good” environment <i>then</i> means the
degeneration of the race. We must therefore <i>appraise
environment in terms of its selective action</i>. A good
environment is that which selects the good, and the best<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_276" id="p_276">[276]</a></span>
environment is that which selects the best; discovers
them, makes the utmost of them, and confers
upon them the supreme privilege and duty of parenthood.
That and that alone is the best environment, and all
other moral judgments upon environment are fallacious
and will be disastrous.</p>

<p><em class="psection">The necessary conclusion.</em>&mdash;National Eugenics teaches
that the first duty of all governments and patriots
and good citizens is, to quote Ruskin again, “the production
and recognition of human worth, the detection
and extinction of human unworthiness.” The idea is
not new-fangled, but was clearly laid down by Plato,
and by Theognis two centuries before him.</p>

<p>Eugenics is a project of the most elevated and provident
morality, aiming at no object less sublime than the ennoblement
of mankind; and if one may suggest its motto it
would be, <i>The products of progress are not mechanisms but
men</i>. It is based upon the principle of the selection or
choice of the superior for parenthood, which has been
the essential factor of all progress in the world of life, but
which all civilisations have tended in some degree to
abrogate&mdash;or even to reverse, as when the feeble-minded
child is cared for till maturity and sent out into the world
to produce its like, whilst healthy children are daily
destroyed by ignorance and neglect.</p>

<p>“Through Nature only can we ascend”&mdash;and the merit
of the eugenic proposal is that it is built upon “the solid
ground of nature.”</p>

<p>To the economist, it declares that <i>the culture of the racial
life is the vital industry of any people</i>.</p>

<p>It is to work through marriage, an institution more
ancient than mankind, and supremely valuable in
its services to childhood&mdash;with which lies all human
destiny.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p_277" id="p_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>Eugenics appeals to the individual, asking for a little imagination,
which will make us realise that the future will one
day be the present and that to serve it is to serve no fiction
or phantom, but a reality as real as the present generation.</p>

<p>It teaches the responsibility of the noblest and most
sacred of all professions, which is parenthood, and it makes
a sober and dignified claim to be regarded as a constituent
of the religion of the future.</p>

<p>It goes to the root of the matter; where the well-meaning,
but short-sighted, pin their faith on the hospitals, the
eugenist seeks to brand the transmission of hereditary
disease as a crime, and thus literally to extirpate it
altogether.</p>

<p>That its methods are practicable is proved by the fact
that it is practised&mdash;as by the northern society for the
“<i>permanent</i> care of the feeble-minded,” which serves
the present and the future simultaneously and reconciles
the law of love with the earlier law of nature&mdash;which
asserts that parenthood must be denied to the unworthy&mdash;without
blame or malice, but without exception. It
suggests the principles of a New Imperialism, and offers,
I submit, our sole chance of escape from the fate which
has overtaken all previous civilisations. It honours men
and women by declaring that human parenthood is crowned
with responsibility to the unborn, and to all time coming,
and that man, the animal in body, is also a self-conscious
being, “looking before and after,” who is human because
he is responsible, and to whom the laws of nature have
been revealed, not to satisfy an intellectual curiosity, but
for the highest end conceivable&mdash;the elevation of his race.</p>

<p>Let me quote a fine passage from Wordsworth's
“Prelude”:&mdash;</p>

<small>NATIONAL EUGENICS: MR. BALFOUR ON DECADENCE</small></h3>

<p>(1) “If the various checks specified in the two last paragraphs,
and perhaps others as yet unknown, do not prevent the reckless,
the vicious, and otherwise inferior members of society from increasing
at a quicker rate than the better class of men, the
nation will retrograde, as has too often occurred in the history
of the world. We must remember that progress is no invariable
rule. It is very difficult to say why one civilised nation rises,
becomes more powerful, and spreads more widely, than another;
or why the same nation progresses more quickly at one time
than at another. We can only say that it depends on an increase
in the actual number of the population, on the number
of the men endowed with high intellectual and moral faculties,
as well as on their standard of excellence. Corporeal structure
appears to have little influence, except so far as vigour of body
leads to vigour of mind.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Darwin</span>, <i>The Descent of Man</i>, 1871.</p>

<p>(2) Referring to “the rates with which the various classes of
society (classified according to civic usefulness) have contributed
to the population at various times, in ancient and modern
nations,” Mr. Francis Galton said “there is strong reason for
believing that national rise and decline is closely connected
with this influence.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Galton</span>, <i>Sociological Papers</i>, 1904, p. 47.</p>

1908.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p_280" id="p_280">[280]</a></span></p>
<p>The lecture of which the previous chapter is the written
form was prepared and delivered before I had an opportunity
of seeing Mr. A. J. Balfour's lecture on “Decadence”
delivered a few days before. That has since been printed,
and is well worthy of our attention. In Mr. Balfour
we have a representative political thinker, an experimental
statesman and, furthermore, a former President
of the British Association, deeply interested in, and
favourably disposed towards, scientific enquiry and
the scientific method. Further, this lecture has been
widely noticed, though all the criticisms I have seen
seem to me to miss the point. No apology, then, is
necessary for a special discussion of this most suggestive
lecture in direct relation with the foregoing theory of its
subject.</p>

<p>Political and national decadence is Mr. Balfour's theme,
and we note first that here is a contemporary thinker,
not unread in recent biology, including the work of
Weismann, who is prepared to make use of the idea
that societies are inherently mortal, as individuals are.
One wonders when we shall be rid of this pernicious
instance of the argument from analogy, which is already
much more than two thousand years old.</p>

<p>Next it may be noticed that, though Mr. Balfour has
deliberately discussed the idea of natural selection, he has
been led wholly astray from its true relation to the question
under discussion by reason of falling into the common
error which Sir E. Ray Lankester has recently exposed,
as Huxley did several decades ago. Mr. Balfour conceives
natural selection to issue from the struggle for existence
between species or societies. It has already been pointed
out that the all-important natural selection is not between
species or societies but within them. The struggle for
existence is fought out mainly between the immature individuals
of any species or society. Its issue determines<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_281" id="p_281">[281]</a></span>
the survivors for parenthood and the future. Mr. Balfour
must have read Professor Ray Lankester's recent Romanes
Lecture in which all this is so clearly shown, but he has
unfortunately retained the popular conception of natural
selection as acting between species or societies, and has
in consequence failed, I will not say to find, but even to
discuss in any adequate measure, the theory of racial and
national decadence, defined in the preceding chapter.
He merely discusses “competition between groups of
communities,” and rightly finds it inadequate to account
for the great tragedies of history.</p>

<p>There follows a passage which may be heartily assented
to, on the very grounds on which the entire lecture may be
welcomed, namely, that it suggests the inadequacy of the
common explanations of national decadence advanced by
historians. Says Mr. Balfour:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It is in vain that historians enumerate the public calamities
which preceded, and no doubt contributed to, the final catastrophe.
Civil dissensions, military disasters, pestilences, famines, tyrants,
tax-gatherers, growing burdens, and waning wealth&mdash;the gloomy
catalogue is unrolled before our eyes, yet somehow it does not in
all cases wholly satisfy us: we feel that some of these diseases are
of a kind which a vigorous body politic should easily be able to
survive, that others are secondary symptoms of some obscurer
malady, and that in neither case do they supply us with the full
explanation of which we are in search.”</p></div>

<p>One must heartily thank the author for the abundant
demonstration which follows, well warranting our feeling
that these explanations do not suffice&mdash;nor yet, in the case
of Rome, diminution of population, nor the “brutalities
of the gladiatorial shows,” nor “the gratuitous distribution
of bread to the urban mobs,” nor yet slavery, lately
declared, by Mr. W. R. Paterson, in his <i>Nemesis of Nations</i>,
to be <i>the</i> cause of the fall of empires. As Mr. Balfour says,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_282" id="p_282">[282]</a></span>“Who can believe that this immemorial custom could,
in its decline, destroy the civilisation which, in its vigour,
it had helped to create?” It would have been more
important, perhaps, to consider, as Mr. Balfour does not,
the latest view, advanced by Professor Ronald Ross, that
the incursion of malaria may have had something to do
with the fall of Rome.</p>

<p><em class="psection">Mr. Balfour's theory&mdash;decadence the cause of
decadence.</em>&mdash;Mr. Balfour then falls back upon “decadence
"as the explanation, and to the critic of this
elegant hypothesis that decadence is due to decadence,
replies that it is something to recognise the possibility of
"subtle changes in the social tissues of old communities.”
One regrets all the more that he should not have considered
anti-eugenic practices as possibly accounting for these
subtle changes. One must, however, quote the excellent
passage in which Mr. Balfour supports his use of the
word decadence, though one utterly disagrees with
the suggestion that the term “old age” might be its
equivalent. He says: “The facile generalisations with
which we so often season the study of dry historic fact;
the habits of political discussion which induce us to
catalogue for purposes of debate the outward signs that
distinguish (as we are prone to think) the standing from
the falling state, hide the obscurer, but more potent,
forces which silently prepare the fate of empires.”</p>

<p>We may note with interest (and surely with surprise
when we consider Japan and Spain and the China of
to-morrow), Mr. Balfour's rejection of the doctrine that
“arrested progress, and even decadence, may be but the
prelude to a new period of vigorous growth. So that
even those races or nations which seem frozen into eternal
immobility may base upon experience their hopes of an
awakening spring.” It is, I fancy, Mr. Balfour's fondness
for the Platonic idea of senility in the race as in the
individual, that leads him to question what can surely
be no longer denied. Thus a little later we find him<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_283" id="p_283">[283]</a></span>
saying, “<i>If civilisations wear out, and races become effete</i>,
why should we expect to progress indefinitely, why for
us alone is the doom of man to be reversed?”</p>

<p>Nowhere in this lecture is there any recognition of
what, I confess, seems to me to be an obvious and necessary
truth, the distinction between the two kinds of
progress&mdash;racial progress due to the choice of the best
for parenthood, and acquired or traditional progress.
It may be suggested that no one can usefully discuss
decadence or progress until he has seen and perceived
this absolutely cardinal distinction, suggested in my
Royal Institution lectures in February, 1907, as one of
the great lessons taught by the study of biology to the
student of progress.</p>

<p>Mr. Balfour does indeed avoid all those false solutions
which depend upon a Lamarckian belief in the transmission
of acquired characters. This, however, instead
of leading him to insist upon the Darwinian contribution
to the study of decadence&mdash;the idea of <i>selection</i>&mdash;causes
him to regard the racial question as unimportant. He
notes one or two of the fashions in which the quality of
a race may be modified, thus influencing national character,
and then dismisses this question (wherein, as I cannot
doubt, everything material lies) with the remark, “But
such changes are not likely, I suppose, to be considerable,
except perhaps those due to the mixture of races&mdash;and that
only in new countries.”&mdash;Reaching page 45, the reader
finds himself confident that now at length the writer
has put his finger on the crux of the problem. Yet
that is how he dismisses it; adding, indeed, to make it
quite clear, the following words: <span class="pagenum"><a name="p_284" id="p_284">[284]</a></span>“The flexible element
in any society, that which is susceptible of progress or
decadence, must therefore be looked for rather in the
physical and psychical conditions affecting the life of
its component units, than in their inherited constitution.”</p>

<p>Not a word as to cessation of selection! This omission,
which is, indeed, the omission of <i>the</i> fact of decadence,
mainly depends, one fancies, upon that erroneous
conception of natural selection as acting between species
and societies rather than within them, which for so
many decades the biologist has been at pains to correct.
One would indeed have thought that, for a scholar and
student like Mr. Balfour, Wordsworth's great sonnet
would have sufficed to set up a train of thought which,
fusing with ordinary biological principles, would have
led him to what I believe to be the truth. Let us for a
moment turn to its consideration:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“When I have borne in memory what has tamed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great Nations, how ennobling thoughts depart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When men change swords for ledgers....”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Should not this be enough to suggest to us the real
meaning of the consequence which has followed when men
changed swords for ledgers, and which even those who
hate war as a vile blasphemy against life must recognise?
It is that, as we have seen, when a nation is making
its way there is selection of the fittest by the stern
arbitrament of war, in which the battle is to the individually
strong and fleet and brave and quick-witted. Later,
“when men change swords for ledgers,” selection ceases;
and that is why nothing fails like success. Yet later
still, as France should know, selection by war must take
the form of reversed selection, the flower of a nation's
youth being immolated on the battle-field, whilst its
future is determined by the weak and small and diseased,
whom the recruiting sergeant rejects. “You are not
good enough to be a soldier,” he says; “stay at home
and be a father.” That was what Napoleon did for
France.</p>

<p>But to return&mdash;for the relations of war to eugenics
would really demand a volume&mdash;it may be noted that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_285" id="p_285">[285]</a></span>
though rejecting the Lamarckian theory&mdash;the theory on
which nothing should succeed like success&mdash;Mr. Balfour
nowhere emphasises the amazing paradox of history that
nothing fails like success. If we consider this fact with
the idea of natural selection in our minds (not between
societies but within them), we cannot fail to perceive
that success involves failure because it involves failure
of selection, and therefore indiscriminate survival; or
indeed, survival of the worst.</p>

<p><em class="psection">Politics and domestics.</em>&mdash;It is, perhaps, a noteworthy
comment upon what may be called the political state of
mind, that even when the idea of natural selection has
entered it, the bias is towards associating it with international
and not with intra-national or domestic politics.
The time will come, however, when the politician&mdash;or
shall we say the statesman?&mdash;realises that it is the
domestic policy, it is the internal struggle for survival
within a society, that conditions and fore-ordains all
international politics. The history of nations is determined
not on the battlefield but in the nursery, and
the battalions which give lasting victory are battalions
of babies. <i>The politics of the future will be domestics.</i></p>

<p>Having rejected so many solutions of his problem,
and having ignored the solution which is advanced in
this volume, Mr. Balfour is reduced to such desperate
resorts as phrases like this: “The point at which the
energy of advance is exhausted”&mdash;a mere meaningless
phrase; and even such an explanation as that through
“mere weariness of spirit the community resigns itself
to ... stagnation.” One is inclined to throw up one's
hands and ask&mdash;Do you, then, who deny the Lamarckian
theory, suppose that the fresh children come into the
world with this “mere weariness of spirit”? Has this
been observed in children? Is there anything conceivable
that has been less observed in children, in all<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_286" id="p_286">[286]</a></span>
times and all places? And if that be so, what kind of
explanation of decadence is this?</p>

<p><em class="psection">Science and industry.</em>&mdash;Lastly, in a series of fine
passages, Mr. Balfour offers us some hope in the help
of science. Politics, says our ex-Premier, too often
means “the barren exchange of one set of tyrants or
jobbers, for another”: a Daniel come to judgment. We
owe the modern spirit and modern progress, he tells us,
neither to politicians nor to political institutions, nor
to theologians nor to philosophers, but to science, which,
he well says, “is the great instrument of social change,
all the greater because its object is not change but knowledge;
and its silent appropriation of this dominant
function, amid the din of political and religious strife,
is the most vital of all the revolutions which have marked
the development of modern civilisation.”</p>

<p>And our cause of hope is “a social force, new in magnitude
if not in kind ... the modern alliance between pure
science and industry.” To this I answer a thousand
times yes, but I must define the kind of industry. It is
the culture of the racial life which is the vital industry
of any nation, and which Mr. Balfour has not even distantly
alluded to. I agree that our hope for the future
is to be found in science: that, as has been said already,
perchance our acquired or traditional progress in knowledge
has now reached the point at which we have sufficient
to reveal to us the necessity of racial progress and the
means by which that may be effected.</p>

<p>“Science and industry,”&mdash;yes, indeed! But the industry
is to be the making not of machines but men.
<i>The products of progress are not mechanisms but men</i>,
and one may now ask, What is the industry whose products
can be named in the same breath with the men and
women who shall yet be produced by the supreme industry
of race-culture?</p>

“The best is yet to be.”</div>


<p>In its form of what we have called <i>negative</i> eugenics,
the practice of our principle would assuredly reduce
to an incalculable extent the amount of human defect,
mental and physical, which each generation now exhibits.
This alone, as has been said, would be far more than
sufficient to justify us. A world without hereditary
disease of mind and body, and its grave social consequences,
would alone warrant the hint of Ruskin
that posterity may some day look back upon us
with “incredulous disdain.” Yet, assuming that this
could be accomplished, as it will be accomplished, what
more is to be hoped for? Must race-culture cease
merely when it has raised the average of the community
by reducing to a minimum the proportion of those who
are thus grossly defective in mind or body? Such
disease apart, are we to be content, must we be content,
with the present level of mediocrity in respect of intelligence
and temper and moral sentiment? Can we
anticipate a London in which the present ratio of musical
comedy to great opera will be reversed, in which the
works of Mr. George Meredith will sell in hundreds of
thousands, whilst some of our popular novelists will
have to find other means of earning a living? Can
we make for a critical democracy which no political
party can fool, and which will choose its best to govern
it? Yet more, can we undertake, now or hereafter, to
provide every generation with its own Shakespeare<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_288" id="p_288">[288]</a></span>
and Beethoven and Tintoretto and Newton? What,
in a word, is the promise of <i>positive</i> eugenics? It is
to this aspect of the question that Mr. Galton has mainly
directed himself. Indeed he was led to formulate the
principles and ideals of the new science by his study of
hereditary genius some four decades ago. Let us now
attempt to answer some of these questions.</p>

<p><em class="psection">The production of genius.</em>&mdash;And first as to the production
of genius. It is this, perhaps, that has been the
main butt of the jesters who pass for philosophers with
some of us to-day. It may be said at once that neither
Mr. Galton nor any other responsible person has ever
asserted that we can produce genius at will. The difficulties
in the way of such a project&mdash;at present&mdash;are
almost innumerable. One or two may be cited.</p>

<p>In the first place, there is the cardinal&mdash;but by no
means universal&mdash;difficulty that the genius is too commonly
so occupied with the development and expansion
of his own individuality that he has little time or energy
for the purposes of the race. This, of course, is an example
of Spencer's great generalisation as to the antagonism
or inverse ratio between individuation and genesis.</p>

<p>Again, there is the generalisation of heredity formulated
by Mr. Galton, and named by him the <i>law of regression
towards mediocrity</i>. It asserts that the children of those
who are above or below the mean of a race, tend to return
towards that mean. The children of the born criminal
will be probably somewhat less criminal in tendency than
he, though more criminal than the average citizen. The
children of the man of genius, if he has any, will probably
be nearer mediocrity than he, though on the average
possessing greater talent than the average citizen. It is
thus not in the nature of sheer genius to reproduce on its
own level. It is only the critics who are wholly ignorant
of the elementary facts of heredity that attribute to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_289" id="p_289">[289]</a></span>
eugenist an expectation of which no one knows the
absurdity so well as he does.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it is impossible to question that
the hereditary transmission of genius or great talent
does occur. One may cite at random such cases as
that of the Bach family, Thomas and Matthew Arnold,
James and John Stuart Mill: and the reader who is
inclined to believe that there is no law or likelihood in
this matter, must certainly make himself acquainted with
Mr. Galton's <i>Hereditary Genius</i>, and with such a paper
as that which he printed in <i>Sociological Papers</i>, 1904,
furnishing an “index to achievements of near kinsfolk
of some of the Fellows of the Royal Society.” There
is, of course, the obvious fallacy involved in the possibility
that not heredity but environment was really
responsible for many of these cases. It must have
been a great thing to have such a father as James Mill.
But it would be equally idle to imagine that the evidence
can be dismissed with this criticism. A Matthew Arnold,
a John Stuart Mill, could not be manufactured out of
any chance material by an ideal education continued
for a thousand years.</p>

<p><em class="psection">The transmission of genius.</em>&mdash;One single instance of
the transmission of genius or great talent in a family
may be cited. We shall take the family which produced
Charles Darwin, the discoverer of the fundamental
principle of eugenics, and his first cousin, Francis Galton.
Darwin's grandfather was Erasmus Darwin, physician,
poet and philosopher, and independent expounder of
the doctrine of organic evolution. Darwin's father was
a distinguished physician, described by his son as “the
wisest man I ever knew.” Darwin's maternal grandfather
was Josiah Wedgwood, the famous founder of
the pottery works. Amongst his first cousins is Mr.
Francis Galton. He has five living sons, each a man of<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_290" id="p_290">[290]</a></span>
great distinction, including Mr. Francis Darwin and Sir
George Darwin, both of them original thinkers, honoured
by the presidency of the British Association. No one
will put such a case as this down to pure chance or to
the influence of environment alone. This is evidently,
like many others, a greatly distinguished stock. The
worth of such families to a nation is wholly beyond any
one's powers of estimation. What if Erasmus Darwin
had never married!</p>

<p>No student of human heredity can doubt that, however
limited our immediate hopes, facts such as those alluded
to furnish promise of great things for the future. But
let us turn now from genius to what we usually call talent.</p>

<p><em class="psection">The production of talent.</em>&mdash;There can be no question
that amongst the promises of race-culture is the possibility
of breeding such things as talent and the mental
energy upon which talent so largely depends. In his
<i>Inquiries into Human Faculty</i>, Mr. Galton shows the
remarkable extent to which energy or the capacity for
labour underlies intellectual achievement. He says,
of energy&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It is consistent with all the robust virtues, and makes a large
practice of them possible. It is the measure of fulness of life; the
more energy the more abundance of it; no energy at all is
death; idiots are feeble and listless. In the enquiries I made
on the antecedents of men of science no points came out more
strongly than that the leaders of scientific thought were generally
gifted with remarkable energy, and that they had inherited the
gift of it from their parents and grandparents. I have since found
the same to be the case in other careers.... It may be objected
that if the race were too healthy and energetic there would be
insufficient call for the exercise of the pitying and self-denying
virtues, and the character of men would grow harder in
consequence. But it does not seem reasonable to preserve sickly
breeds for the sole purpose of tending them, as the breed of foxes
is preserved solely for sport and its attendant advantages. There
is little fear that misery will ever cease from the land, or that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_291" id="p_291">[291]</a></span>
compassionate will fail to find objects for their compassion; but
at present the supply vastly exceeds the demand: the land is
over-stocked and over-burdened with the listless and the incapable.
In any scheme of eugenics, energy is the most important quality
to favour; it is, as we have seen, the basis of living action, and it
is eminently transmissible by descent.”</p></div>

<p>Need it be pointed out that any political system which
ceases to favour or actively disfavours energy, making
it as profitable to be lazy as to be active, is anti-eugenic,
and must inevitably lead to disaster? That, however,
by the way. Our present point is that eugenics can
reasonably promise, when its principles are recognised,
to multiply the human<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> and diminish the vegetable
type in the community. In so doing, it will greatly
further the production of talent, and therefore of that
traditional or acquired progress which men of talent and
genius create. Such a result will also further, though
indirectly, the production of genius itself. For, as Mr.
Galton points out, “men of an order of ability which is
now very rare, would become more frequent, because the
level out of which they rose would itself have risen.”</p>

<p>This is by no means the only fashion in which an
effective and practicable race-culture would serve genius,
and I shall not be blamed for considering this matter
further by any reader who realises, however faintly, what
the man of genius is worth to the world. If it were
shown possible to establish such social conditions that
genius could never flower in them, we should realise that
their establishment would mean the putting of an end
to progress and the blasting of all the highest hopes of the
highest of all ages.</p>

<p>The immediate need of this age, as of all ages, is perhaps
not so much the birth of babies capable of developing
into men and women of genius, as the full exploitation<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_292" id="p_292">[292]</a></span>
of the possibilities of genius with which, as I fancy, every
generation on the average is about as well endowed as
any other. There is, of course, the popular doctrine that
there are no mute inglorious Miltons, that “genius will
out,” and that therefore if it does not appear, it is not
there to appear. In expressing the compelling power of
genius in many cases, this doctrine is not without truth.
Yet history abounds in instances where genius has been
destroyed by environment&mdash;and we can only guess how
many more instances there are of which history has no
record. To take the single case of musical genius, it is
a lamentable thought that there may be those now living
whose natural endowments, in a favourable environment,
would have enabled them to write symphonies fit to
place beside Beethoven's, but whom some environmental
factors&mdash;conventional, economic, educational, or what
not&mdash;have silenced; or worse, have persuaded to write
such sterile nullities as need not here be instanced. There
is surely no waste in all this wasteful world so lamentable
as this waste of genius.</p>

<p>If, then, anyone could devise for us a means by which
the genius, potentially existing at any time, were realised,
he would have performed in effect a service equivalent
to that of which eugenics repudiates the present possibility&mdash;the
actual creation of genius. But if we consider
what the conditions are which cause the waste of genius,
we realise at once that they mainly inhere in the level
of the human environment of the priceless potentiality
in question. As we noted elsewhere, in an age like that
of Pericles genius springs up on all hands. It is encouraged
and welcomed because the average level of the
human environment in which it finds itself is so high.
But if eugenics can raise the average level of intelligence,
in so doing not merely does it render more likely, as Mr.
Galton points out, the production of men of the highest<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_293" id="p_293">[293]</a></span>
ability, but it provides those conditions in which men of
genius, now swamped, can swim. We could not undertake
to produce a Shakespeare, but we might reasonably
hope to produce a generation which would not damage or
destroy its Shakespeares. And even if men of genius still
found it necessary, as men of genius have found it necessary,
to “play to the gallery,” they would play, as Mr. Galton
says of the demagogue in a eugenic age, “to a more
sensible gallery than at present.”</p>

<p>Darwin somewhere points out that it is not the
scientific, but the unscientific man who denies future
possibilities. Thus though an advocate of eugenics may be
applauded for his judgment if he declares that the creation
of genius will for ever be impossible, yet I should not care
to assert that the ultimate limitations of eugenics can thus
be defined. We have yet to hear the last of Mendelism.</p>

<p><em class="psection">Eugenics and unemployment.</em>&mdash;Let us look now at
another aspect of the promise of race-culture. When the
time comes that quality rather than quantity is the ideal
of those who concern themselves with the population
question, it is quite evident that not a few of the social
problems which we now find utterly insoluble will disappear.
In this brief outline, we can only allude to one
or two points. Take, for instance, the question of
unemployment. We know that some by no means small
proportion of the unemployed were really destined to
be unemployable from the first, as for instance by reason
of hereditary disease. It were better for them and
for us had they never been born. Many more
of the unemployed have been made unemployable
by the influence of over-crowding, to which they were
subjected in their years of development. Is there, can
there be, any real and permanent remedy for over-crowding,
but the erection of parenthood into an act of
personal and provident responsibility?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p_294" id="p_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<p><em class="psection">Eugenics and woman.</em>&mdash;Take, again, the woman
question. No one will deny that in many of its
gravest forms, especially in its economic form, and
the question of the employment of women, wisely
or horribly, this depends (to a degree which few, I
think, realise) upon the fact that there are now, for
instance, 1,300,000 women in excess in this country. Is
it then proposed, the reader will say, by means of race-culture
to exterminate the superfluous woman? Indeed,
no. But is the reader aware that Nature is not responsible
for the existence of the superfluous woman? There
are more boys than girls born in the ratio of about 103
or 104 to 100: and Nature means them all to live, boys
and girls alike. If they did so live, we should have
merely the problem of the superfluous man, which would
not be an economic problem at all. But we destroy
hosts of all the children that are born, and since male
organisms are in general less resistant than female organisms,
we destroy a disproportionate number of boys, so
that the natural balance of the sexes is inverted. Unlike
ancient societies, we largely practise <i>male</i> infanticide.
Can the reader believe that there is any permanent and
final means of arresting this wastage of child-life, with
its singular and far-reaching consequences,&mdash;other than
the elevation of parenthood, on the principles which
race-culture enjoins, even wholly apart from the
question of the selection of parents? We shall not
succeed in keeping all the children alive (with a
trivial number of exceptions), thereby abolishing the
superfluous woman by keeping alive the boy who
should have grown up to be her partner, until we
greatly reduce the birth-rate; as it must and will be
reduced when the ideal of race-culture is realised, and
no child comes into the world that is not already loved
and desired in anticipation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p_295" id="p_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p><em class="psection">Eugenics and cruelty to children.</em>&mdash;This ideal, also,
offers us in its realisation the only complete remedy
for the present ghastly cruelty under which so many
children suffer even in Great Britain, even in the
twentieth century. Is the reader aware that the
National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Children enquired into the ill-treatment or cruel neglect
of 115,000 children in the year beginning April 1st, 1906?
It has been reasonably and carefully estimated that
“over half a million children are involved in the total
of the wastage of child-life and the torture and neglect
of child-life in a single year.” Surely Mr. G. R. Sims,
to whom I would offer a hearty tribute for his recent
services to childhood, is justified in saying, “Against the
guilt of race-suicide our men of science are everywhere
preaching their sermons to-day. It is against the guilt
of race-murder that the cry of the children should ring
through the land.” As regards race suicide and the
men of science, I am not so sure as to the assertion. But
the truth of the second sentence quoted is as indisputable
as it is horrible.</p>

<p>Now no legislation conceivable will wholly cure this
evil nor avert its consequences. At bottom it depends
upon human nature, and you can cure it only by curing
the defect of human nature. This, in general, is of
course beyond the immediate powers of man, but evidently
we should gain the same end if only we could confine the
advent of children to those parents who desired them&mdash;that
is to say, those in whom human nature displayed
the first, if not indeed almost the only, requisite for the
happiness of childhood. To this most beneficent and
wholly moral end we shall come, notwithstanding the
blind and pitiable guidance of most of our accredited
moral teachers to-day. By no other means than the
realisation of the ideal defined, that every new baby<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_296" id="p_296">[296]</a></span>
shall be loved and desired in anticipation&mdash;an ideal
which is perfectly practicable&mdash;can the black stain of
child murder and child torture and child neglect be
removed from our civilisation.</p>

<p><em class="psection">Ruskin and race-culture.</em>&mdash;The name of Ruskin, perhaps,
would not occur to the reader as likely to afford
support to the fair hopes of the eugenist. Consider then,
these words from <i>Time and Tide</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“You leave your marriages to be settled by supply and demand,
instead of wholesome law. And thus, among your youths and
maidens, the improvident, incontinent, selfish, and foolish ones
marry, whether you will or not; and beget families of children
necessarily inheritors in a great degree of these parental dispositions;
and for whom, supposing they had the best dispositions
in the world, you have thus provided, by way of educators, the
foolishest fathers and mothers you could find; (the only rational
sentence in their letters, usually, is the invariable one, in which
they declare themselves ‘incapable of providing for their children's
education’). On the other hand, whosoever is wise, patient,
unselfish, and pure among your youth, you keep maid or
bachelor; wasting their best days of natural life in painful
sacrifice, forbidding them their best help and best reward, and
carefully excluding their prudence and tenderness from any offices
of parental duty. Is not this a beatific and beautifully sagacious
system for a Celestial Empire, such as that of these British
Isles?”</p></div>

<p>Apart from the point as to wholesome law rather than
the education of opinion as the eugenic means, the foregoing
passage must win the assent and respect of every
eugenist. It indicates the promise of race-culture as it
appeared to John Ruskin. The passage has been quoted
in full not for the benefit of the ordinary thoughtful
reader but for that of the professional literary man who,
in this remarkable age, so far as I can judge, reads nothing
but what he writes, and thus qualifies himself for dismissing
Spencer or Darwin or Galton in any casual phrase&mdash;meanwhile<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_297" id="p_297">[297]</a></span>
condemning Ruskin, whom he probably
professes to adore.</p>

<p><em class="psection">Race-culture and human variety.</em>&mdash;Now let us turn to
another question. Let it be asserted most emphatically
that, if there is anything in the world which eugenics or
race-culture does <i>not</i> promise or desire, it is the production
of a uniform type of man. This delusion, for which there
has never been any warrant at all, possesses many of the
critics of eugenics, and they have made pretty play with it,
just as they do with their other delusions. Let us note one
or two facts which bear upon this most undesirable ideal.</p>

<p>In the first place, it is unattainable because of the
existence of what we call variation. No apparatus conceivable
would suffice to eliminate from every generation
those who varied from the accepted type.</p>

<p>In the second place, this uniformity is supremely
undesirable from the purely evolutionary point of view,
because its attainment would mean the arrest of all
progress. All organic evolution, as we know, depends
upon the struggle between creatures possessing variations
and the consequent selection of those variations
which constitute their possessors best adapted or fitted
to the particular environment. If there is no variation
there can be no evolution. To aim at the suppression of
variation, therefore, on supposed eugenic grounds (which
would be involved in aiming at any uniform type of
mankind) would be to aim at destroying the necessary
condition of all racial progress. The mere fact that the
critics of race-culture attribute to evolutionists, of all
people, the desire to suppress variation, is a pathognomic
symptom of their critical quality.</p>

<p>And, of course, quite independently of the evolutionary
function of variation&mdash;though this is cardinal and must
never be forgotten by the politician of any school, since
what we call individuality is variation on the human<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_298" id="p_298">[298]</a></span>
plane&mdash;the value of variation in ordinary life is wholly
incalculable. It is not merely that, as Mr. Galton says,
“There are a vast number of conflicting ideals, of alternative
characters, of incompatible civilisations; but they
are wanted to give fulness and interest to life. Society
would be very dull if every man resembled the highly
estimable Marcus Aurelius or Adam Bede.” The question
is not merely as to the interest of life. Much more important
is the fact that it takes all sorts to make a world.
What is the development of society but the result of the
psychological division of labour in the social organism?
And how could such division of labour be carried out if
we had not various types of labourers? What would be
the good of science if there were no poetry or music to
live for? How would poetry and music help us if we
had not men of science to protect our shores from plague?</p>

<p>Obviously the existence of men of most various types
is a necessity for any highly organised society. Even if
eugenics were capable&mdash;as it is not&mdash;of producing a
complete and balanced type, fit up to a point to turn
out a satisfactory poem, a satisfactory symphony or a
satisfactory sofa, the utmost could not be expected of
such a man in any of these directions. In a word, as
long as their activities are not anti-social, men cannot be
of too various types. We require mystic and mathematician,
poet and pathologist. Only, we want good
specimens of each. “The aim of eugenics,” says Mr.
Galton, “is to represent each class or sect by its best
specimens; that done, to leave them to work out their
common civilisation in their own way.... Special
aptitudes would be assessed highly by those who possessed
them, as the artistic faculties by artists, fearlessness of
enquiry and veracity by scientists, religious absorption
by mystics, and so on. There would be self-sacrificers,
self-tormentors, and other exceptional idealists.” But at<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_299" id="p_299">[299]</a></span>
least it is better to have good rather than bad specimens
of any kind, whatever that kind may be. Mr. Galton
thinks that all except cranks would agree as to including
health, energy, ability, manliness and courteous disposition
amongst qualities uniformly desirable&mdash;alike in
poet and pathologist. We should desire also uniformity
as to the absence of the anti-social proclivities of the born
criminal. So much uniformity being granted, let us have
with it the utmost conceivable variety,&mdash;more, indeed,
than most of us can conceive.</p>

<p>This point, of course, is cardinal from the point of view
of practice. No progress could be made with eugenics,
it would be impossible even to form a Eugenics Education
Society, if each of us were to regard the particular type he
belongs to as the ideal, and were to seek merely to obtain
the best specimens of that type. The doctrine that it
takes all sorts to make a world&mdash;a doctrine very hard for
youth to learn, yet unconsciously learnt by all who are
capable of learning at all&mdash;must be regarded as a cardinal
truth for the eugenist. But he wisely seeks good specimens
rather than bad. Poets certainly, but not poetasters;
jesters certainly, but not clever fools, who stand Truth on
her head and then make street-boy gestures at her.</p>

<p><em class="psection">Time and its treasure.</em>&mdash;Taking the modern estimates
of the physicists, we are assured that the total period
of past human existence is very brief compared with
what may reasonably be predicted. Granted, then,
practically unlimited time, what inherent limits are
there to the upward development of man as a
moral and intellectual being? Shall we answer this
question by a study of the nature of matter? Plainly
not. Shall we answer it by a study of the nature of
mind? Surely not, for the study of existing mind
cannot inform us as to what mind might be. One source
of guidance alone we have, and this is the amazing contrast<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_300" id="p_300">[300]</a></span>
which exists between the mind of man at its highest, and
mind in its humblest animal forms: or shall we say even
between the highest and lowest manifestations of mind
within the human species? The measureless height of
the ascent thus indicated offers us no warrant for the
conclusion that, as we stand on the heights of our life,
our “glimpse of a height that is higher” is only an
hallucination. On the contrary.</p>

<p>There is no warrant whatever for supposing that the
forces which have brought us thus far are yet exhausted:
they have their origin in the inexhaustible. Who, gazing
on the earth of a hundred million years ago, could have
predicted life&mdash;could have recognised, in the forces then
at work and the matter in which they were displayed,
the promise and potency of all terrestrial life? Who,
contemplating life at a much later stage, even later
mammalian, could have seen in the simian the prophecy
of man? Who, examining the earliest nervous ganglia,
could have foreseen the human cerebrum? The fact
that we can imagine nothing higher than ourselves, that
we make even our gods in our own image, offers no
warrant for supposing that nothing higher will ever be,
What ape could have predicted man, what reptile the bird,
what amœba the bee? “There are many events in the
womb of time which will be delivered,” and the fairest
of her sons and daughters are yet to be.</p>

<p>But even grant, for the sake of the argument, that the
intelligence of a Newton, the musical faculty of a Bach,
the moral nature of any good mother anywhere, represent
the utmost limits of which the evolution of the psychical
is capable. There is every reason to deny this, but let
us for the moment assume it true. There still remains
the thought of Wordsworth, “What one is, why may not
millions be?”&mdash;a thought to which Spencer has also
given utterance. What is shown possible for human<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_301" id="p_301">[301]</a></span>
nature here and there, he says, is conceivable for human
nature at large. It is possible for a human being, whilst
still remaining human, to be a Shakespeare or a St.
Francis: these things are thus demonstrably within the
possibilities of human nature. It is therefore at the
least conceivable that, in the course of almost infinite
time (even assuming, say, that intelligence must ever be
limited, as even Newton's intelligence was limited), some
such capacities as his may be common property amongst
men of the scientific type; and so with other types. We
may answer Wordsworth that there is no bar thrown by
Nature in the way of such a hope.</p>

<p><em class="psection">What is possible?</em>&mdash;This, of course, is speculation and
of no immediate value. I would merely remind the reader
that the doctrine of optimism, as regards the future of mankind,
which the principles of race-culture assume and which
they desire to justify, was definitely shared by the great
pioneers to whom we owe our understanding of those
principles. Notwithstanding grave nervous disorder, such
as makes pessimists of most men, both Darwin and Spencer
were compelled by their study of Nature to this rational
optimism as regards man's future. The doctrine of
organic evolution, and of the age-long ascent of man
through the selection of the fittest (who have, <i>on the
whole</i>, been the <i>best</i>) for parenthood, is one not of despair
but of hope. Exactly half a century ago it struck horror
into the minds of our predecessors. Man, then, is only
an erected ape, they thought&mdash;as if any historical doctrine,
however true, could shorten the dizzy distance to which
man has climbed since he was simian: and man being
an ape, they thought his high dreams palpably vain.
But the measure of the accomplished hints at the measure
of the possible, and the value of the historical facts lies

principles which grow out of them. It is of no importance
as such that man has simian ancestors; it is of immeasurable
importance that he should learn by what
processes he has become human, and by what, indeed,
they became simian&mdash;which would have been a proud
adjective for its own day. The principles of organic
progress matter for us because they are the principles of
race-culture, the only sure means of human progress.
Our looking backwards does not turn us into pillars of
salt, but teaches us that the best is yet to be, and how
alone it is to be attained.</p>

<p><em class="psection">Conclusion&mdash;Eugenics and Religion.</em>&mdash;In an early
chapter it was attempted to show that eugenics is
not merely moral, but is of the very heart of morality.
We saw that it involves taking no life, that, rather,
it desires to make philanthropy more philanthropic,
that, at any rate so far as this eugenist is concerned,
it recognises and bows to the supreme law of
love: and claims to serve that law, and the ideal of
social morality, which is the making of human worth.
Eugenics may or may not be practicable, it may or may
not be based upon natural truth, but it is assuredly
moral: though I, for one, would proclaim eternal war
between this real morality and the damnable sham which
approves the unbridled transmission of the most hideous
diseases, rotting body and soul, in the interests of good.</p>

<p>And if religion, whatever its origin and the more
questionable chapters in its past, be now “morality
touched with emotion,” I claim that eugenics is religious,
is and will ever be a religion. Elsewhere<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> I have attempted
to show that religion has survived and will
survive because of its survival-value&mdash;its services to the
life of the societies wherein it flourishes. The religion
of the future, it was sought to argue, will be that which
“best serves Nature's unswerving desire&mdash;fulness of life.”
The Founder of the Christian religion said, “I am come
that ye might have life, and that ye might have it more
abundantly.” It is higher and more abundant life that
is the eugenic ideal. Progress I define as the emergence
and increasing dominance of mind. Of progress, thus
conceived, man is the highest fruit hitherto. He is also
its appointed agent, and eugenics is his instrument.</p>

<p>To this end he must use all the powers which have
blossomed in him from the dust. He must claim Art:
and indeed in Wagner's great music-drama, at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_304" id="p_304">[304]</a></span>
moment when the prophetic Brünnhilde tells Sieglinde
who has just lost her mate that she, the expectant mother,
may look for the resurrection of the dead and the life
of the world to come in the child Siegfried; and when
the heroic theme is pronounced for the first time and
followed by that which signifies redemption by love&mdash;then,
I think, the eugenist may thrill not merely to the
music, or to the humanity of the story, but to the spiritual
and scientific truth which it symbolises.</p>

<p>If the struggle towards individual perfection be religious,
so, assuredly, is the struggle, less egoistic, indeed,
towards racial perfection. If the historic meaning and
purport of religion are as I conceive them, and if its
future evolution may thence be inferred, there can be no
doubt in the prophecy that in ages to come those high
aspirations and spiritual visions which astronomy has
dishoused from amongst the stars, and which, at their
best, were ever selfish, will find a place on this human
earth of ours. If we have transferred our hopes from
heaven to earth and from ourselves to our children, they
are not less religious. And they that shall be of us shall
build the old waste places; for we shall raise up the
foundations of many generations:</p>

<small>CONCERNING BOOKS TO READ</small></h2>


<p>The preceding pages are of course only tentative, preliminary
and introductory. I have merely tried to make
a beginning. No better purpose can be achieved than
that the reader should proceed to study the subject for
himself. A few pages may therefore be devoted to the
names of some of the books which will be found useful.
This is in no sense a complete bibliography, nor even a
tithe of such a bibliography. But the reader who makes
a beginning with the books here named, or even with a
well-chosen half dozen of them, will thereafter need no
one to tell him that the culture of the human race on
scientific principles will be the supreme science of all the
future, the supreme goal of all statesmen, the object and
the final judge of all legislation.</p>

<p>Where it is thought that useful remarks can be made
they will be made, but neither their presence nor absence
nor their length is to be taken as any index to the writer's
opinion of the relative value of the works in question.</p>

<p><i>Heredity.</i> (The Progressive Science Series, 1908.)
By <span class="smcap">Professor J. A. Thomson, M.A.</span></p>

<p>This is the most recent and most valuable for general
purposes of all books on the subject of heredity. No
layman should express opinions on heredity or eugenics
until he has read it, for it is extremely improbable that
they will be valuable. Professor Thomson covers the
whole ground with extreme lucidity and care and impartiality.
The book is readable, nay more, fascinating
from end to end, and it is liberally and usefully illustrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_306" id="p_306">[306]</a></span>.
It is the first general treatise on heredity which leads
consciously, yet as of necessity, towards eugenics as the
crown and goal of the whole study, and in this respect
it undoubtedly marks an epoch.</p>

<p><i>The Methods and Scope of Genetics.</i> (1908.) By
<span class="smcap">W. Bateson, M.A., F.R.S.</span></p>

<p>This is the inaugural lecture, destined, I have little
doubt, to become historic, which was delivered by Professor
Bateson on his appointment to the new Darwin Chair of
Biology at Cambridge. It is purposely included here for
very good reasons. The reader who begins his serious
study of heredity with Professor Thomson's work must
be informed that though the author gives an interesting
account of Mendelism, he is not a Mendelian, and neither
his account of Mendelism nor his estimate of it is at all
adequate for the present day. In truth there is the
study of heredity before Mendelism and after, and
though eugenics owes its modern origin to the founder
of the school of biometrics, and though among his followers
there are to be found many who decry and oppose the
Mendelians, it is for the eugenist of single purpose to
take the truth wherever it is to be found. It is now
idle to deny either the general truth or the stupendous
promise of Mendelism. Many vital phenomena besides
heredity are studied by the statistical method, and are
put down by it to heredity. The Mendelians take seeds
of known origin, and plant them and note the result.
They carry out experimental breeding not only amongst
plants but amongst the higher animals, including
mammals who, in all essentials of structure and function,
are one with ourselves. It is not possible, I believe, to
over-estimate the supreme importance of Mendelian
enquiry for eugenics. Eugenics is founded upon heredity,
and genetics, which is Professor Bateson's name for the
physiology of heredity and variation, is now working at<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_307" id="p_307">[307]</a></span>
the very heart of those natural phenomena upon which
eugenics depends. This lecture of Professor Bateson's
is by the far the best introduction to Mendelism that
exists, besides being the most recent and the most
authoritative possible. With the lucidity of the born
teacher (whose faculty, I have no doubt, is a Mendelian
unit, not always inherited by the born observer) the
author explains the essence of Mendelism. The usual
expositor has not proceeded far upon his way before he
is encumbering himself and the learner with the phenomena
of dominance and recessiveness, which are not
cardinal and are highly involved. Professor Bateson
makes no allusion to them. But he gives an account of
Mendelism which it is impossible to put down without
finishing, and which is elementary in the highest sense of
the word. In the later pages the author preaches
eugenics with a vigour and conviction not unworthy of
notice as coming from the leader of a school which is
utterly opposed in principle and in methods, if not in
results, to the school of biometrics founded by the founder
of eugenics. I insist upon this because there is a half-instructed
ignorance abroad which has heard the name
of Mendel, and seeks thereby to discredit Darwin and
natural selection, Mr. Galton and eugenics. Hear
Professor Bateson:&mdash;</p>

<p>“If there are societies which refuse to apply the new
knowledge, the fault will not lie with Genetics. I think
it needs but little observation of the newer civilisations to
foresee that <i>they</i> will apply every scrap of scientific knowledge
which can help them, or seems to help them in the
struggle, and I am good enough selectionist to know that in
that day the fate of the recalcitrant communities is sealed.”</p>

<p><i>Hereditary Genius, An Inquiry into its Laws and Consequences.</i>
By <span class="smcap">Francis Galton</span>.</p>

<p>This is the classical and pioneer enquiry, far beyond<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_308" id="p_308">[308]</a></span>
my praise or appraisement. The main text is not long,
is easily read and is extremely interesting. The reader
should acquaint himself also with Mr. Constable's recent
criticism, <i>Poverty and Hereditary Genius</i>.</p>

<p><i>A Study of British Genius.</i> (1904.) By <span class="smcap">Havelock
Ellis</span>.</p>

<p>This is an extremely interesting book, which should be
read in association with the foregoing, to which it is a
criticism and supplement. The greater part of the
volume is concerned with the study of genius from the
point of view of heredity&mdash;in terms of nationality and
race, and of individual parentage. Very great labour
and scholarship have been expended to very high purpose
in this work.</p>

<p><i>Inquiries into Human Faculty.</i> (1883.) By <span class="smcap">Francis
Galton</span>.</p>

<p>This is the next in order of Mr. Galton's works, <i>Hereditary
Genius</i> dating from 1869. It has recently been
reprinted in Dent's “Everyman's Library,” and can
thus be purchased for one shilling.</p>

<p><i>Natural Inheritance.</i> (1889.) By <span class="smcap">Francis Galton</span>.</p>

<p><i>Memories of my Life.</i> (1908.) By <span class="smcap">Francis Galton</span>.</p>

<p>This is Mr. Galton's latest book, and apart from its
personal fascination must be read by the serious eugenist
if only on account of its last five chapters, and especially
the last two, which deal with Heredity and Race Improvement.
What could be more interesting and significant,
for instance, than to find Mr. Galton in 1908 saying of
himself in 1865, “I was too much disposed to think of
marriage under some regulation, and not enough of the
effects of self-interest and of social and religious sentiment.”
Mr. Galton comments on the wrongheadedness
of objectors to eugenics. I fancy, however, that the
familiar misrepresentations will soon cease to be possible.
The whole of this brief last chapter must be carefully<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_309" id="p_309">[309]</a></span>
read and studied. At least I must quote the following
paragraph:&mdash;</p>

<p>“What I desire is that the importance of eugenic
marriages should be reckoned at its just value, neither
too high nor too low, and that eugenics should form one
of the many considerations by which marriages are
promoted or hindered, as they are by social position,
adequate fortune, and similarity of creed. I can believe
hereafter that it will be felt as derogatory to a person of
exceptionally good stock to marry into an inferior one
as it is for a person of high Austrian rank to marry one
who has not sixteen heraldic quarterings. I also hope
that social recognition of an appropriate kind will be
given to healthy, capable, and large families, and that
social influence will be exerted towards the encouragement
of eugenic marriages.”</p>

<p>This volume, a model for all future autobiographers,
ends with the following splendid statement of the eugenic
creed:&mdash;</p>

<p>“A true philanthropist concerns himself not only with
society as a whole, but also with as many of the individuals
who compose it as the range of his affections can include.
If a man devotes himself solely to the good of a nation
as a whole, his tastes must be impersonal and his conclusions
so far heartless, deserving the ill title of ‘dismal’
with which Carlyle labelled statistics. If, on the other
hand, he attends only to certain individuals in whom he
happens to take an interest, he becomes guided by
favouritism and is oblivious of the rights of others and
of the futurity of the race. Charity refers to the individual;
Statesmanship to the nation; Eugenics cares
for both.</p>

<p>“It is known that a considerable part of the huge stream
of British charity furthers by indirect and unsuspected
ways the production of the Unfit; it is most desirable
that money and other attention bestowed on harmful
forms of charity should be diverted to the production
and well-being of the Fit. For clearness of explanation
we may divide newly married couples into three classes,
with respect to the probable civic worth of their offspring.
There would be a small class of ‘desirables,’
a large class of ‘passables,’ of whom nothing more will
be said here, and a small class of ‘undesirables.’ It
would clearly be advantageous to the country if social
and moral support as well as timely material help were
extended to the desirables, and not monopolised as it
is now apt to be by the undesirables.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p_310" id="p_310">[310]</a></span>“I take eugenics very seriously, feeling that its principles
ought to become one of the dominant motives in a
civilised nation, much as if they were one of its religious
tenets. I have often expressed myself in this sense,
and will conclude this book by briefly reiterating my
views.</p>

<p>“Individuals appear to me as partial detachments from
the infinite ocean of Being, and this world as a stage on
which Evolution takes place, principally hitherto by
means of Natural Selection, which achieves the good of
the whole with scant regard to that of the individual.</p>

<p>“Man is gifted with pity and other kindly feelings; he
has also the power of preventing many kinds of suffering.
I conceive it to fall well within his province to replace
Natural Selection by other processes that are more
merciful and not less effective.</p>

<p>“This is precisely the aim of eugenics. Its first object
is to check the birth-rate of the Unfit, instead of allowing
them to come into being, though doomed in large
numbers to perish prematurely. The second object is the
improvement of the race by furthering the productivity of
the Fit by early marriages and healthful rearing of their
children. Natural Selection rests upon excessive production
and wholesale destruction; Eugenics on bringing
no more individuals into the world than can be properly
cared for, and those only of the best stock.”</p>

<span class="smcap">George Chatterton-Hill</span>.</p>

<p>This is a useful and interesting work, the nature of
which is well indicated by its title. It contains many

<p><i>The Germ-plasm, A Theory of Heredity.</i> (The Contemporary

<p>This is Weismann's great work. It should be studied

phenomena in terms of Lamarckian theory, and also by
modern writers who are so much more Weismannian
than Weismann.</p>

Reid</span>.</p>

<p>This is a very interesting and extremely Weismannian
book which contains the most recent statement of the
author's remarkable enquiries into the influence of disease
as a factor of human selection.</p>

Reprinted 1906.) By <span class="smcap">Charles Darwin</span>.</p>

<p>These classics now cost only half-a-crown apiece.</p>

<p>The beginner should read <i>The Descent of Man</i> first,<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_312" id="p_312">[312]</a></span>
I think. Some of the earlier chapters are of the utmost
eugenic value, and would be found immensely interesting
by modern lecturers on decadence, and the like.</p>

<p><i>Darwinism To-day.</i> (1907.) By <span class="smcap">Vernon L. Kellogg</span>.</p>

<p>An interesting and scholarly recent criticism, containing

“authorities” on the Woman Question.</p>

<p><i>A History of Matrimonial Institutions.</i> (1904.) By
<span class="smcap">G. E. Howard</span>.</p>

<p>This is a three-volume treatise, extremely comprehensive,

of the subject. Only the professional student can be
expected to read it from cover to cover, but it is invaluable
for purposes of reference.</p>

<p><i>The History of Human Marriage.</i> By <span class="smcap">E. Westermarck</span>.</p>

<p>This rightly celebrated and epoch-making work demonstrates
in especial the survival-value of monogamy,
and its historical dominance as a marriage form.</p>

<p><i>The Principles of Population.</i> By <span class="smcap">T. R. Malthus</span>.</p>

<p>The substance of this may be conveniently read in the
extracts published in the <i>Economic Classics</i> by Macmillan
(1905).</p>

<p><i>The Principles of Biology.</i> By <span class="smcap">Herbert Spencer</span>.</p>

<p>The last section, “The Laws of Multiplication,” <i>must</i>
be read as the expression of the missing half of the truth
discovered by Malthus. It is tiresome, nearly half a
century after Spencer's enunciation of his law, to have to
read the remarks of some modern writers who continue<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_313" id="p_313">[313]</a></span>
to assume that Malthus expressed not merely the truth
but the whole truth.</p>

<p><i>The Republic of Plato.</i></p>

<p>Apart from the lines of Theognis quoted by Darwin in
<i>The Descent of Man</i>, which are some two centuries older
than Plato, the fifth book of the <i>Republic</i> is the earliest
discussion in literature of the idea of eugenics, and utterly
wild though we may consider most of the proposals of
Plato&mdash;or Socrates&mdash;to be, these early thinkers are yet
more modern and more scientific and more fundamental
than all their successors, even including our modern
Utopia makers who have come after Darwin, in recognising
that it is the quality of the citizen which will make a
Utopia possible. The following will suffice to show that
after more than two thousand years we can still learn
from the fundamental idea of Plato's fifth chapter:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It is plain, then, that after this we must make marriages as
much as possible sacred; but the most advantageous should be
most sacred. By all means. How then shall they be most advantageous?
Tell me that, Glauco, for I see in your houses
dogs of chace, and a great many excellent birds. Have you
then indeed ever attended at all, in any respect, to their
marriages, and the propagation of their species? How? said
he. First of all, that among these, although they be excellent
themselves, are there not some who are most excellent? There
are. Whether then do you breed from all of them alike? or
are you careful to breed chiefly from the best? From the best.
But how? From the youngest or from the oldest, or from those
who are most in their prime? From those in their prime. And
if the breed be not of this kind, you reckon that the race
of birds and dogs greatly degenerates. I reckon so, replied he.
And what think you as to horses, said I, and other animals?
is the case any otherwise with respect to these? That, said he,
were absurd.”</p></div>

<p>Plato proposed to destroy the family, and to “practise
every art that no mother should know her own child.”
He also approved of infanticide. Nevertheless, this fifth<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_314" id="p_314">[314]</a></span>
book of the <i>Republic</i> is interesting and valuable reading,
and it is especially well to note that this pioneer of
Utopianism and Socialism possessed the idea which almost
all living Socialists, except Dr. A. R. Wallace and
Professors Forel and Pearson, lack, that we must first
make the Utopian and Utopia will follow.</p>

<p><i>The Family.</i> (1906.) By <span class="smcap">Elsie Clews Parsons</span>.</p>

<p>This recent, scholarly and lucid book, of which any
living man might well be proud, may follow the reading
of the utterly unconcerned and taken-for-granted fashion
in which Socrates and Plato proposed to destroy the
family. Lecture VIII., on “Sexual Choice,” is brief,
but the references following it are extremely valuable
and complete. It is evident that one of the books which
will have to be written on eugenics in the near future
must deal with the whole question of marriage and human
selection both in its historical and in its contemporary
aspects.</p>

<p>This was the Huxley Lecture of the Anthropological

eugenics may be said to date from it.</p>

<p>“Eugenics, its Definition, Scope and Aims.” (<i>Sociological
Papers.</i> 1904.) By <span class="smcap">Francis Galton</span>.</p>

<p>This remarkable lecture constituted a further introduction
of the subject, and it is somewhat of the nature
of an impertinence for the professional jester, who is not
acquainted with a line of it, to dismiss eugenics with a
phrase as if this lecture had never been written or were
unobtainable. Mr. Galton there defined eugenics as “the
science which deals with all influences that improve the
inborn qualities of a race....” The definition given<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_315" id="p_315">[315]</a></span>
in the <i>Century Dictionary</i> is unauthoritative, incorrect,
and misses the entire point.</p>

<p>An extremely valuable discussion follows this lecture,
and it is absolutely necessary for the student to acquaint
himself with the whole of these pages (45&ndash;99).</p>

Eugenics as a Factor in Religion.</i> By <span class="smcap">Francis Galton</span>.</p>

<p><i>Probability, the Foundation of Eugenics.</i> The Herbert

<p>This lecture contains a very brief historical outline
of the recent progress of eugenic enquiry and a
simple discussion of the mathematical method of studying
heredity. It must, of course, be read by every
serious student.</p>

By <span class="smcap">Karl Pearson</span>.</p>

<p>This is a reprint of a lecture delivered by Professor

back far. The first chapter is indeed a reprint of a eugenic
article published in the <i>Fortnightly Review</i> as far back as
1872. Some of us may perhaps be inclined to forget
that more than a generation ago Mr. Crackanthorpe had
grasped the great truths which we are now trying to
spread, and had courageously expressed them in the face of
ignorance and prejudice even greater than those of to-day.
This is unquestionably a book which every student must
read, but the press generally, with some notable exceptions,
have fought rather shy of it. It was sent to
the present writer at his request from a leading morning
paper which trusts him, and he wrote a column on it,
most careful in diction and moderate in opinion, which
was, nevertheless, not printed. One of the leading
medical papers devoted a long article to the book, written
on the general principle that it is right for a medical
paper to differ from any non-medical person who approaches
the closed neighbourhood of medical enquiry.
Another leading medical paper considered Mr. Crackanthorpe's
“ideal” to be “beyond present accomplishment,”
and feared it must have “many generations of
probation before it could hope to enter the sphere of
practical politics.” I venture to say that <i>Population
and Progress</i>, dealing, as it does, with a subject that
really matters, contains more fundamental practical
politics&mdash;in the true sense of that word&mdash;than has been
discussed in most of our current newspapers since they
were first established.</p>

<p><i>Race-Culture or Race-Suicide.</i> (1906.) By <span class="smcap">R. R.
Rentoul</span>.</p>

<p>This is a second and enlarged edition of a remarkable
pamphlet published by Dr. Rentoul in 1903 under the
title <i>Proposed Sterilisation of Certain Mental and Physical
Degenerates. An Appeal to Asylum Managers and Others.</i>
Dr. Rentoul's own description of this pamphlet is as<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_317" id="p_317">[317]</a></span>
follows:&mdash;“In it I called attention to the large and
increasing number of the insane in the United Kingdom;
to our disgraceful system of child-marriages; to the
growing suicide rate; to our disgusting system of inducing
certain mentally and physically diseased persons to
marry; and to a slight operation which I was the first
to propose as a means of checking the increase in the
number of the insane, and in preventing innocent offspring
from being cursed by some parental blemish.”</p>

<p><i>Education.</i> (Originally published in 1861. New edition,
with the author's latest corrections, 1906.) By <span class="smcap">Herbert
Spencer</span>.</p>

<p>This is the classic which marks an epoch in the personal
development of every one who reads it, and which made
an epoch in the history of education: the book was
probably of more service to woman, owing to its liberation
of girlhood, than any other of its century.</p>

<p><i>The Study of Sociology.</i> (International Scientific Series.
Originally published in 1873. Twentieth edition, 1903.)
By <span class="smcap">Herbert Spencer</span>.</p>

<p>This is, of course, <i>the</i> introduction to sociology, written
for that purpose by a master, and in every respect a
masterpiece. It contains many eugenic references and
arguments. As far as the eugenic education of the
adult is concerned, this is rightly the preliminary
work.</p>

<p>Besides <i>The Evolution of Sex</i> and Mrs. Parson's book on
<i>The Family</i>, there are many others relevant to the question
of woman and eugenics, of which one or two may be noted
here.</p>

<p><i>Sex and Society, Studies in the Social Psychology of Sex.</i>
(1907.) By <span class="smcap">W. I. Thomas</span>.</p>

<p>This is a very readable and recent work, and for
the general reader much the most suitable of any that
I know.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p_318" id="p_318">[318]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Man and Woman.</i> (Contemporary Science Series.)
By <span class="smcap">Havelock Ellis</span>.</p>

<p>A very clear and readable book.</p>

<p><i>Youth&mdash;its Education, Regimen and Hygiene.</i> (1907.)
By <span class="smcap">Stanley Hall</span>.</p>

<p>This is a new and abbreviated version of Professor
Stanley Hall's two well-known volumes on <i>Adolescence</i>,
published in 1904. For the general reader this much
smaller work is very suitable, and especial attention may
be directed to Chapter XI., “The Education of Girls.”</p>

<p>It would have been presumptuous and absurd to
attempt, in the course of a merely introductory volume,
to deal, by anything more than allusion to its existence,
with the great question of human parenthood in relation
to race. Most urgently this question, of course, concerns
the negro problem in America. The student who has to
trust entirely to second-hand knowledge had best be
silent. Lest, however, the reader should imagine that
the older doctrines of race can be accepted without
reserve, he will do well to study very carefully the latter
part of Dr. Archdall Reid's book, already referred to, and,
with extreme caution, the following:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Race Prejudice.</i> (1906.) By <span class="smcap">Jean Finot</span>.</p>

<p>This book most of us must believe to be extreme,
but it should be read: it bears on what may be called
international eugenics, and the whole question of inter-racial
marriage.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On matters of transmissible disease and racial poisons
there is much literature. Only one or two books can be
referred to here.</p>

<p><i>The Diseases of Society: The Vice and Crime Problem.</i>
(1904.) By <span class="smcap">G. F. Lydston</span>.</p>

<p>This, of course, is not a pleasant book, and it is open to
much criticism in many respects, but it is well worth<span class="pagenum"><a name="p_319" id="p_319">[319]</a></span>
reading, especially in association with Dr. Rentoul's
work.</p>

<p><i>Malaria&mdash;A Neglected Factor in the History of Greece and
Rome.</i> (1907.) By <span class="smcap">W. H. S. Jones</span>, with an introduction
by <span class="smcap">Ronald Ross</span>.</p>

<p>This is a recent historical study and may be a very
substantial contribution to the study of decadence.</p>

<p><i>Alcoholism.</i> (1906.) By <span class="smcap">W. C. Sullivan</span>.</p>

<p>This little book of Dr. Sullivan's contains a useful and
scrupulously moderate chapter on the relation of alcohol
to human degeneration.</p>

<p><i>The Drink Problem.</i> (1907.) By Fourteen Medical
Authorities.</p>

<p><i>The Children of the Nation.</i> (1906.) By <span class="smcap">Sir John Gorst</span>.</p>

<p><i>Infant Mortality.</i> (1906.) By <span class="smcap">George Newman</span>.</p>

<p><i>The Hygiene of Mind.</i> (1906.) By <span class="smcap">T. S. Clouston</span>.</p>

<p><i>Diseases of Occupation.</i> (1908.) By <span class="smcap">Sir T. Oliver</span>.</p>

<p><i>The Prevention of Tuberculosis.</i> (1908.) By <span class="smcap">A.
Newsholme</span>.</p>

<p>These volumes all deal in part with questions of
racial poisoning and racial hygiene.</p>

<p><i>Alcoholism&mdash;A Study in Heredity.</i> (1901.) By
<span class="smcap">Archdall Reid</span>.</p>

<p><i>Alcohol and the Human Body.</i> (1907.) By <span class="smcap">Sir Victor
Horsley</span> and <span class="smcap">Mary D. Sturge</span>.</p>

<p><i>Hygiene of Nerves and Mind.</i> (The Progressive Science
Series. 1907.) By <span class="smcap">August Forel</span>.</p>

<p><i>Inebriety&mdash;Its Causation and Control.</i> (The second
Norman Kerr Memorial Lecture, published in the <i>British
Journal of Inebriety</i>, January, 1908.) By <span class="smcap">R. Welsh
Branthwaite</span>.</p>

<p><i>Reports of the Inspector under the Inebriates Acts.</i>
Especially those for the years 1904, 1905, 1906.</p>

<p><i>The Cry of the Children: The Black Stain.</i> (1907.)
By <span class="smcap">G. R. Sims</span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p_320" id="p_320">[320]</a></span></p>

<p>The above are especially recommended to politicians.
Sooner or later, as never yet, knowledge will have to be
applied to the drink question as it bears upon the quality
of the race. The knowledge exists, and is not difficult
to acquire or understand. The references given are quite
sufficient to enable any one of mediocre intelligence to
frame a bill dealing with alcohol which would be worth
all its predecessors put together, and would arouse far
less opposition than any one of them.</p>

<p><i>Reports of the National Conference on Infantile Mortality</i>
1906 and 1908 (P. S. King &amp; Co.). In the 1906 Report
note especially Dr. Ballantyne's paper on the unborn
infant, and in the 1908 Report, Miss Alice Ravenhill's
paper on the education of girls.</p>

<p>It must be repeated that the foregoing names are
merely noted as including, perhaps, the greater number
of the books with which the serious beginner would do
well to make a start. That is all. It would be both
unfair and unwise, however, to omit any mention of at
least three wonderful little books of John Ruskin's:
<i>Unto this Last</i>, <i>Munera Pulveris</i> and <i>Time and Tide</i>, which
add to their great qualities of soul and style some of the
most forcible and wisest things that have ever been
written on race-culture and its absolutely fundamental
relation to morality, patriotism and true economics.</p>

<p>If the reader desires the name of only one book, that is
certainly <i>The Sexual Question</i> (1908), by Professor
<span class="smcap">August Forel</span>. This has no rival anywhere, and
cannot be overpraised.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_6" id="Footnote_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> We have seen that Huxley's assertion of the fundamental opposition
between moral and cosmic evolution is unwarrantable. We do recognise,
however, that in our present practice this opposition exists. Our
ancestors were cruel to the insane, but at least they prevented them
from multiplying. We are blindly kind to them, and therefore in the
long run cruel. But the dilemma, kind to be cruel, or cruel to be kind,
is not necessary. It is quite possible, as we have asserted, to be at once
kind to the individual and protective of the future. On the other hand,
it is also possible to be cruel to both. The London County Council
offers us, at the time of writing, a demonstration of this. Sending
wretched inebriates on the round of police-court, prison and street, with
intermittent gestations, rather than expend a shilling a day, per
individual, in decently detaining them, it serves at least the philosophic
purpose of demonstrating that it is possible to combine the maximum of
brutality to the individual and the present with the maximum of injury
to the race and the future.</p></div>

that of Charles Darwin who, referring to his own phrase, natural selection,

<p><a name="Footnote_12" id="Footnote_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> Spencer introduced the non-moral word evolution in 1857, <i>in order to</i>

employed.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_13" id="Footnote_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> In his recent work, <i>The Origin of Vertebrates</i>, Dr. W. H. Gaskell,
F.R.S., has adduced much evidence in support of this thesis. He says,
“The law of progress is this: The race is not to the swift nor to the
strong, but to the wise.” And again; “As for the individual, so for the
nation; as for the nation, so for the race; the law of evolution teaches
that in all cases brain-power wins. Throughout, from the dawn of
animal life up to the present day, the evidence given in this book
suggests that the same law has always held. In all cases, upward
progress is associated with the development of the central nervous system.
The law for the whole animal kingdom is the same as for the individual.
‘Success in this world depends upon brains.’”</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_14" id="Footnote_14"></a><a href="#FNanchor_14"><span class="label">[14]</span></a> We may recall the words of Lear:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
“Is man no more than this? Consider him well: Thou owest the
worm no silk, the beast no hide, the sheep no wool, the cat no perfume:....
Thou art the thing itself: unaccommodated man is no more but
such a poor, bare, forked animal as thou art.”</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_15" id="Footnote_15"></a><a href="#FNanchor_15"><span class="label">[15]</span></a> Says Darwin, “So little is this subject understood, that I have heard
surprise repeatedly expressed at such great monsters as the Mastodon ...
having become extinct; as if mere bodily strength gave victory in the
battle of life. Mere size, on the contrary, would in some cases determine
... quicker extermination from the greater amount of requisite food.”
In the Russo-Japanese War, one of the effective factors was the greater
area of the Russian soldier as a target, and the disparity between the
food requirements of the little victors and the big losers.</p></div>

not important. In proportion to body weight man's birth-rate is
lower than theirs. And it is to be noted that the “infant” mortality is
very low in this case, where the birth-rate is so low. Says Darwin, of
the young elephant. “None are destroyed by beasts of prey; for even the
tiger in India most rarely dares to attack a young elephant protected by
its dam.” The dam has no factory to go to, and no beast of prey to sell
her alcohol.</p></div>

large volume. There is no space here to detail the fashion in which
the drunken mother poisons her child after birth, when she nurses
it, since, as has been chemically proved, alcohol is excreted in her
milk. Says a most distinguished authority, Mrs. Scharlieb, “the
child, then, absolutely receives alcohol as part of his diet, with the
worst effect upon his organs, for alcohol has a greater effect upon
cells in proportion to their immaturity” (“The Drink Problem,” in the
New Library of Medicine), and Dr. Sullivan refers to “numerous cases
on record of convulsions and other disorders occurring in infants
when the nurse has taken liquor, and ceasing when she has been put
on a non-alcoholic diet.” The reader may be referred to my brief

attention has been called to the following passage, not irrelevant here.
It is from the <i>Attic Nights</i> of Aulus Gellius, Book xii., chap. i., written
about <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 150&mdash;Gibbon's critical epoch. I use the free translation of
Mr. Quintin Waddington:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
“Once when I was with the philosopher Favorinus, word was
brought to him that the wife of one of his disciples had just given
birth to a son.
</p>
<p>
“‘Let us go,’ said he, ‘to enquire after the mother, and to congratulate
the father.’ The latter was a noble of Senatorial rank.
</p>
<p>
“All of us who were present accompanied him to the house and
went in with him. Meeting the father in the hall, he embraced and
congratulated him, and, sitting down, enquired how his wife had come
through the ordeal. And when he heard that the young mother,
overcome with fatigue, was now sleeping, he began to speak more freely.
</p>
<p>
“‘Of course,’ said he, ‘she will suckle the child herself.’ And when
the girl's mother said that her daughter must be spared, and nurses
obtained in order that the heavy strain of nursing the child should
not be added to what she had already gone through, ‘I beg of you,
dear lady,’ said he, ‘to allow her to be a whole mother to her child.
Is it not against nature, and being only half a mother, to give birth
to a child, and then at once to send him away? To have nourished
with her own blood and in her own body a something that she had
never seen, and then to refuse it her own milk, now that she sees it
living, a human being, demanding a mother's care? Or are you one
of those who think that nature gave a woman breasts, not that she
might feed her children, but as pretty little hillocks to give her bust
a pleasing contour? Many indeed of our present-day ladies&mdash;whom
you are far from resembling&mdash;do try to dry up and repress that sacred
fount of the body, the nourisher of the human race, even at the risk
they run from turning back and corrupting their milk, lest it should
take off from the charm of their beauty. In doing this they act
with the same folly as those, who, by the use of drugs and so
forth, endeavour to destroy the very embryo in their bodies, lest a
furrow should mar the smoothness of their skin, and they should
spoil their figures in becoming mothers. If the destruction of
a human being in its first inception, whilst it is being formed,
whilst it is yet coming to life, and is still in the hands of its artificer,
Nature, be deserving of public detestation and horror, is it not nearly
as bad to deprive the child of his proper and congenial nutriment to
which he is accustomed, now that he is perfected, is born into the
world, is a child?
</p>
<p>
“But it makes no difference&mdash;for as they say&mdash;so long as the child
is nourished and lives, with whose milk it is done.
</p>
<p>
“Why does he who says this, since he is so dull in understanding
nature, think it also of no consequence in whose womb and from
whose blood the child is formed and fashioned? For is there not now
in the breasts the same blood&mdash;whitened, it is true, by agration and heat&mdash;which
was before in the womb? And is not the wisdom of Nature
to be seen in this, that as soon as the blood has done its work of
forming the body down below, and the time of birth has come, it
betakes itself to the upper parts of the body, and is ready to cherish
the spark of life and light by furnishing to the new-born babe his
known and accustomed food? And so it is not an idle belief, that,
just as the strength and character of the seed have their influence
in determining the likeness of the body and mind, so do the nature
and properties of the milk do their part in effecting the same results.
And this has been noticed, not in man alone, but in cattle as well.
For if kids are brought up on the milk of ewes, or lambs on that of
goats, it is agreed that the latter have stiffer wool, the former
softer hair. In the case of timber and fruit trees, too, the qualities of
the water and soil from which they draw their nourishment have more
influence in stunting or augmenting their growth than those of the
seed which is sewn, and often you may see a vigorous and healthy
tree when transplanted into another place perish owing to the poverty
of the soil.
</p>
<p>
“Is it then a reasonable thing to corrupt the fine qualities of the
new-born man, well endowed as to both body and mind so far as
parentage is concerned, with the unsuitable nourishment of degenerate
and foreign milk? Especially is this the case, if she whom you get
to supply the milk is a slave or of servile estate, and&mdash;as is very often
the case&mdash;of a foreign and barbarous race, if she is dishonest, ugly,
unchaste, or <i>addicted to drink</i>. For generally any woman who happens
to have milk is called in, without further enquiry as to her suitability
in other respects. Shall we allow this babe of ours to be tainted by
pernicious contagion, and to draw life into his body and mind from
a body and mind debased?
</p>
<p>
"This is the reason why we are so often surprised that the children
of chaste mothers resemble their parents neither in body nor character.
</p>
<p>
“... And besides these considerations, who can afford to ignore
or belittle the fact that those who desert their offspring and send
them away from themselves, and make them over to others to nurse,
cut, or at least loosen and weaken that chain and connection of mind
and affection by which Nature attaches children to their parents. For
when the child, sent elsewhere, is away from sight, the vigour of
maternal solicitude little by little dies away, and the call of motherly
instinct grows silent, and forgetfulness of a child sent away to nurse
is not much less complete than that of one lost by death.
</p>
<p>
“A child's thoughts and the love he is ever ready to give, are occupied,
moreover, with her alone from whom he derives his food, and
soon he has neither feeling nor affection for the mother who bore him.
The foundations of the filial feelings with which we are born being
thus sapped and undermined, whatever affection children thus brought
up may seem to have for father and mother, for the most part is not
natural love, but the result of social convention.’”</p></div>
